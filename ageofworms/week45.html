<h3>Week 45 - Say, do you smell Limburger? ; or: Lazaroo phones a friend; or: Screechy goes the three-quarter facelock; or simply: Flash. Dragonslayer.</h3>
<div class="smaller">
<p>
Well, a lot happened this week, really. Three encounters, as opposed to our usual two. Actually, it’s not always that slow, but as usual between modules the first half of the session was shopping and working with Mend the Cheesemonger. Owing to a strange rip in the space-time continuum, Gauthakan’s counterpart in the parallel universe - Harmony the Monk - subbed in for him, while he was off doing other XP-earning stuff. 
</p>
<p>
For the other DMs out there: I’m finding this module difficult in that this part of it is actually an urban adventure, so you have to think on your feet a little more than with a dungeon. The module simply says “there’s a guardpost there” without maps or anything, and it doesn’t really spell out what the NPCs do. Ideally I’d like “if A happens, then the npc does A<sub>1</sub>” and so on. What you get is “These guys are allied with those guys”. Oh well, it just means you have t do a little storytelling.
</p>
<p>
The other issue is that the boys are tossing ninth-level spell around now, and it can be a little difficult to keep on top of. But that’s high-level 3.5 for you. Suck it up, DM.
</p></div><p>
<div class="sidel"><div class="sideh">The Goradra Gap</div>
<p>The largest and deepest canyonin Khorvaire, the Goradra Gap extends into the depths ofKhyber itself. Legends speak of vast monsters and otherbeasts lurking within the gap, and of a hidden kingdomthat can only be reached from the depths of Goradra.</p>
<hr>
<p>
An arid wasteland broken only by the occasionalrock formation or copse of scruboaks stretches to the horizon in all directionssave one. In this direction, the landdrops away into the immense gulf of theRift Canyon. It stretches as far as the eyecan see to the east and west, a bogglinggash in the face of the world. The windblowing over the strange rock formationsperched on the canyon’s lips makes a hollowmoaning sound.
</p><p>One hundred feet below the top of thecliff, an immense ruined city of stone liesnestled in a wide, open cavern. Hundredsof multi-leveled buildings and towersrise inside this cavern, creating a verticalcityscape of spires, battlements, and stonebridges. Spires of rock protruding precariouslyfrom the cliff’s lower face rise upbefore the cityscape. Some of these spiresare barren, capped only by the odd bushor rock formation, but two support largecastles of their own, and connect to themain city via slender bridges of stone.Smoke rises from several parts of theruined city, and many of the buildings arerecently damaged or destroyed. The source ofthis damage is readily apparent, for the city ofKongen-Thulnir is under siege by dragons.
</p>
</div>
<a name="limberger">And so, reeking of cheese and radiating magic like a forest of christmas trees</a>, our heroes behold - from a safe distance - the Goradra Gap, where lies the phylactery of the Lich, Dragotha. Flash casts <i>Veil</i> and they head in, disguised as a pack of wolves.
</p><p>
As they approach, they can see what transpires in a little more detail. The gap extends downward into the earth, its depths concealed by a cloudbank and sheer distance. Built into the wall a a short distance below the lip is a fortified city carved out of the rock and built on gigantic scale. The dragons are besieging that town. A little closer and - no, your eyes aren’t deceiving you - it’s peopled and defended by giants operating giant-sized ballistae and catapults.
</p><p>
There are a set of giant-sized steps cut into the cliff, leading down to the city. The party pause at the top debating what to do. They send Elvis in, but he does not notice anything in particular beyond what the party has already noted. 
</p><p>
Necrozyte, disgraced servitor of Tiamat herself circles above and notes that that hunting pack of wolves below are acting oddly. But deep down, she <i>wants</i> to believe that they are simply wolves (she’s had a bad day, she’s distracted) and so accepts the truth that Flash’s illusion offers her. Frith spots her, high above, but she flies off and nothing comes of it.
</p><p class="smaller">
I would have liked a little more colour text in the Eberron conversion notes for the individual named dragons in this module. I don’t know if there <em>is</em> a Tiamat in Eberron. Ideally there’s be some fluff text about her tracing their lineage back to Khyber, or something.
</p><p>
After this, however, the party decide to get a move on. Shadow walking is to imprecise, wind-walking leaves them horribly vulnerable if they are spotted, they can’t see the end of the path to teleport, so their best option seems to be just to negotiate the stairs. About halfway down, Necrozyte returns do see a hunting pack of wolves purposefully making their way down a set of giant stairs into a war zone. This time she shakes off her distraction and sees the party for what it is. The party spot a huge green dragon, circling above, casting buffs (although she is 100ft up, so they can’t make out exactly what). They start casting <i>Protection from Acid</i> all around.
</p><p>
<a name="phone">Lazaroo pulls out a scroll, for which he paid a <em>lot</em> of gold. <i>Gate</i>. With apologies to Christopher Palloni, he calls Brisingr - Ancient Bronze Dragon and by repute always ready for a fight in a good cause.</a> Brisingr is not terribly pleased at being gated in at the whim of a human(oid?), and Lazaroo flubs his rushed diplomacy check. With each second vital, Flash steps in: “Honoured-and-Mighty Brisingr - we beg your forgiveness but we are sore pressed by <em>her</em>”. Brisingr looks up and his expression turns flinty. “Necrozyte!” and without further ado he takes to the air.
</p><p>
Necrozyte has finished her buffs. She orders three younger black dragons to deal with the party, and dives on Brisingr. As she passes the party, she uses a quickened dragon breath to bathe them in acid. Then Brisingr dives at her, and the two spiral out of sight.
</p><p>
Frith or Mend cast <i>Blade Barrier</i> to protect the path. The three dragons respond by flying along the length of it, breathing their acid breath through it. Then it’s ranged spell time. Frith or Mend does another Blade Barrier in mid-air, a line of clashing blades passing through all three dragons. One of them, already damaged from another spell, falls. The other two move back a little further. Eventually one manages to get another spitball ready, and heads towards the party. But Flash catches him with a <i>Power Word Stun</i> and he smacks headlong into the cliff and then tumbles down its face in Homer-esque fashion. The third black dragon chooses the better part of valour and leaves.
</p><p>
After a minute or so, Brisingr returns - scorched with acid along the length of him, but with an unmistakable air of triumph. He adresses Lazaroo. 
</p><div class="smaller"><p>What’s a DM to do? How do you allow players to use <i>Gate</i>, without having the characters gate in an army and go home, leaving them to do the work? Let’s just all gate in a few demigods, explain the Age of Worms to them, and go home and find something else to do on a Friday, eh?
</p><p>
Ahh - maybe it’s not that bad, now that I’ve had time to read the spell. I just overreacted on the night because Steve sprang it on me.
</p><p>
In all fairness: Gate is a PHB spell which <em>does</em> permit a 15th-level caster to gate in an old Bronze dragon and command it to fight for one battle or do another task liable to take about a minute and a half. Furthermore, Bronze Dragons are straight out of the Monster Manual and they specifically like a fight. Gating in a Bronze Dragon and having it fight another dragon for you is 100% core and a legitimate way to play a high-level caster. An objection is that dragons are not extraplanar, but on Eberron they probably are: hanging out in Thelanis or something. There’s also campaign reasons for dragons not taking an active part in these events &hellip; but being gated in by one of the heroes of prophecy probably allows one to bend the rules a bit.
</p><p>
So I hereby re-think my hasty on-the-spot decision to nerf <i>Gate</i>. I should have conferred with each player each time they leveled up their characters so at to be able to run the game more smoothly. Live and Learn.
</p><p>
However: Steve claims that he simply bought the scroll and did not pay the XP cost. The XP cost is there for a reason. As I have stated on several occasions, anything beyond medium magic items are not for sale on Eberron. That includes scrolls containing ninth level spells with an XP cost. That’s exactly why Dave went to so much trouble to build an artificer. You want a scroll of Gate, then scribe it yourself or have Mend do it. Unless Mend <em>did</em> do it, I suppose.
</p><p>
So, what happened on the night didn’t actually happen. <em>This</em> is what actually happened:
</p></div><div class="cutscene"><p>
A good fight. Your summons caught me by surprise, but I knew Necrozyte of old. For ages I have not been able to deal with her myself, as she has hid in the shadow of Tiamat. Her recent disgrace and banishment come at a convenient time.
</p><p>
Now. As to you, little wizard:
</p><p>
Our prophecies are difficult, and the wiser of us choose not to take a hand in them. Many dragons have sought to bend the prophecies to their own purposes - Dragotha among them (yes, of course I know Dragotha) - and most have met unpleasant ends of one sort or another. But to come in response to a summons from one of the heroes of prophecy (yes, of course the prophecies mention you) - that, I think, can be done without excessive disturbance to the weave.
</p><p>
Do not presume too much, but if you call me again, then I will come.
</p></div><p class="smaller">
That’s assuming that Brisingr is level-appropriate for Lazaroo - ancient bronze dragons are 33HD, which falls within the 17 * 2 = 34 limit. Technically, Lazaroo can force him to serve and at 20th level will be able to command a Great Wyrm &hellip; .
</p><p>
And with that, Brisingr <i>Plane Shifts</i> out.
</p><div class="divbreak">&mdash;&nbsp;&dagger;&nbsp;&mdash;</div><p>
<div class="sidel">
<div class="sideh">A. City Gate</div>The only land route into Kongen-Thulniris a thirty-foot-wide ledge that windsdown from the edge of the Rift Canyonabove. Access to Kongen-Thulnir via thisledge is controlled by the gate here, aforty-foot-tall, two-story structure madeof bronzewood poles bound with heavychains. A sixty-foot tower with a battlementroof and many loopholes watchesover the area.</div>
The party head further down the path. At the end is a massive gate. As the party move into view, a few giant-sized balista bolts come their way. Flash casts <i>Greater Mirror Image</i> and runs forward to make a rushed diplomacy roll. “Parley!” (actually, hill giants have an INT of 6, so in giantish it was more like:) “No fight! No fight! Strong-and-good-looking giants, me not want fight! Me friend!”.
</p><p>
Such is Flash’s amazing gift of the gab, that the giants are prepared to listen. “Who you?”. Flash casts a stilled, silenced <i>Glibness</i> and, with utter conviction and sincerity, says “Me name Flash-who-is-dragon-killer!”
</p><p>
Well! This causes some comment. With a little more breathing room for flattery, Flash persuades the giants to become helpful. It turns out that as well as a seige by dragons, Kongen-Thilnir is in the middle of a civil war. The king is old and dying, and these giants are loyalists. The rival faction lives in the undercity. These giants have lost their commander to a huge green dragon - pobably Necrozyte - and have holed up in this tower. But if Flash-who-is-dragon-killer will escort them, they will strike out for the palace, clear at the other side of the city.
</p><p>
Oh. One other thing. Both Flash and Mend note that the entire city has some sort of enchantment on it. It’s subtle, very faint, and it’s difficult to tell exactly what it does to those in its area of effect. Probably with a little more time, they will be able to tell.
</p><p>
Two other things, in fact. The city is strung with chains across the cavern into which it is built, carefully painted to be difficult to see from outside (although they are perfectly obvious from inside). And most of the ballistae and other fortifications point outward into thin air. These fortifications are <em>old</em>, although kept in good order. In other words: this place was built to withstand a siege from the air. A siege by dragons.
</p><div class="divbreak">&mdash;&nbsp;&dagger;&nbsp;&mdash;</div><p>
<div class="sidel"><div class="sideh">B. Northern Kongen-Thulnir</div>The northern section of the ruined cityhad already seen its share of combat bythe time the dragon siege began, for itwas here that the majority of the skirmishesbetween the rival factions has taken place. Buildingsstacked one upon the other rise almostto the cavern’s 100-foot ceiling at the rearwall. None of the dwellings delve far intothe mountain. This area’s residents areprimarily hill giants with bugbear slaves,although those that remain here haveretreated deep into their homes to hide.
</div>
<div class="sidel" style="clear: left; margin-top: 1em;"><div class="sideh">C. City Well</div>Water gurgles up into a cistern cut in therock, where it is funneled into an aqueductthat travels under a bridge and overthe cliff’s edge. The river is only 5 feetdeep and the current is not very strong.The smooth-sided cistern itself is 40 feetdeep. The water here is pure, althoughcontrol over it has shifted between thewarring factions too manytimes to count in recent memory. Currently,no giants control the well, and itswaters are undefended.
</div>

Well, striking out across the city is not without its perils, and peril comes in the form of three adult green dragons that swoop down on our party and the dozen or so giants they are escorting. They strike the guylines, injuring themselves somewhat, and land. The giants choose to dive for cover, leaving our party to deal with them.
</p><p class="smaller">
Screechy the owlbear is an awakened animal, with 8 levels of Barbarian.
</p><p>
<a name="facelock">Screechy rages, and advances to attack one of the dragons. There are a couple of spells, and the dragon attacks screechy and does a fair amount of damage. Then screechy grabs the dragon in an owlbear hug. It fails to win free and Screechy pins it.</a>
</p><p>
Meanwhile, Lazaroo casts <i>Shapechange</i>, off another scroll. He changes into an earth elemental and glides through the ground, emerging next to where screechy has pinned the dragon. He then changes into a Marilith and begins attacking with six fists.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, Mend advances forward to where the other two dragons are, and casts a bag of <i>Dust of Sneezing and Choking</i> into the air. The dragons are helpless, while he and the warforged Monk - Harmony - are unaffected.
</p><p>
<a name="dragonslayer">The third dragon is almost dead from Screechy’s and Lazaroo’s attacks. Flash pulls out a wand of <i>Magic Missile</i> and does 14 points of damage, killing it. The giants emerge from their hiding places. “Hooray for Flash! Flash-who-is-dragon-killer!”.</a> Then all twelve of them get to stomping the other two dragons, helpless with sneezing and choking.
</p><div class="divbreak">&mdash;&nbsp;&dagger;&nbsp;&mdash;</div><p class="smaller">
Hooray for Flash, indeed. A very, very fine kill-steal. But, they are not halfway across the war-zone yet. Where’s the phylactery, do you suppose? Could be anywhere. Next week - more fun.
