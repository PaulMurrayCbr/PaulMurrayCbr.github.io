<h3>Week 20 - Russell Crowe, and a little Nancy Drew.</h3>
<p class="smaller">A straightforward session this week. Let's get started! As always - don't expect me to remember evey little detail.</p>
<p>



The four teams: Arcane Auriga, Badlands Revenge, Sapphire Squad, and Rough Diamond, enter the arena and take their assigned positions. Sapphire Squad and Arcane Auriga
are opposite one another at one end of the oval arena, and Rough Diamond
and Badlands Revenge opposite one another at the other. As the sand in the enormous eggtimer begins running down, teams begin
buffing. Potions are drunk, spells are incanted. Frith casts Enlarge Person
on Tom, boosting him to huge size - a move much appreciated by the crowd.
</p>
<p class="smaller">

I have ruled that Tom the half-ogre is <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypostatic_union">both fully giant and fullly
human</a>, and therefore is subject to any spells that affect humaniods as
well as being subject to any effects that affect giants.
</p>
<p>

The druid leading Badlands Revenge cats Flaming Hands. Then the horn
sounds, and it's on.
</p>
<p>

The combat begins with Arcane Auriga firing upon Badlands Revenge, and
Joren - the leader - replying with firey missiles from his spell. Sapphire
Squad charge Arcane Auriga, their flashing sabres doing terrible damage.
Rough Diamond fighters charge Badlands Revenge. The combat appears to be
unfolding much as planned the previous night. Sapphire Squad hold up their
end of the bargain and the antagonizing of Arcane Auriga by Flash
impersonating a gnoll also pays off.  Very quickly a hasted Arn and a huge
Tom decimate the gnolls before their druid can cast another spell. The
leader of the Sapphire Squad and the leader of the Arcane Auriga engage in
single combat and she soon surrenders, along with one of her fighters. By
the time Rough Diamond reach the other end of the arena to assist the
horsemen it's nearly over. When the last elf submits, Rough Diamond and
Sapphire Squad commence to battle one another. The horsemen turn on our
heroes with a strafing run at Tom's rear end, a quick spell from Flash
conjures a solid cloud of fog amongst the fracas. Tom slams the leader of
the sapphire squad knocking him senseless then cleaves his warhorse
knocking it senseless too.  The party quickly subdue the remainder of the
opposition and Tom gives the Sapphire Squad leader and his horsey an
aeroplane ride. Declared the victors, Flash receives the trophy: a bronze
boar. Their manager, Ekaym, accepts a more prosaic prize: money - to be
divided up later. Rough Diamond has made it through to the next round. The
crowd settles its various bets. Some of the more bloodthirsty are
disappointed by the absence of fatalities and the speed with which the
combat was resolved, but most are suitably impressed.
</p>
<p>

The party collects their winnings and Ekaym presents them with the prize
money when they return to the Coenoby deep beneath the arena floor. Then he
admits he has an agenda. <insert speech here>   Apparently his sister was
Raknian's lover and disappeared at the end of the last championship. Ekaym
needed a gladiator team to gain entrance to the arena, but if the heroes
themselves investigate and uncover his sister's fate, he will waive his
manager's fee.
</p>
<p>

Frith explores the option of asking the netherworld but finds no leads so
it looks like good old sleuthing. Flash and Jericho sneak up the next layer
at night, when there is less activity. They scout the area, avoiding guards
by Flash's invisibility spells and Jericho's skills at stealth. They
explore the majority of the level, avoiding disturbance to the guards and
caged animals, and eventually find a prisoner shackled in a cell.  The
deranged man looks like a beggar and is terrified of the other cells which
appear empty. He is deaf and mute, but Flash manages to communicate. He
draws pictures on the ground of worms, and motions at his face. Flash and
Jericho remember the undead the party encountered in the basement of
Blackwall Keep, and conclude that he has seen the spawn of Kyuss.
</p>
<p>

Flash and Jericho return him - invisibly - to the Coenoby hoping that Frith
would be able to aid him.  Frith's determines that the man is insane and it
is beyond his abilities to heal that level of sickness.  The cerebral party
members attempt to communicate with the man but all they can get from him
is he's terrified of worm riddled zombies that were in the cell opposite
him. Luckilly, they recall Ekaym's offer of healing magics, and resolve to
have him source a scroll of Heal or Greater Restoration - expensive, but he
is sure to agree as this prisoner may be able to reveal clues as to the
final fate of his sister.
</p>
<p class="smaller">
But that will take a day or two. First, they must fight round 2 of the
Champion's Games. Their foe shall be Pitch Blade, the dwarven triplets.
