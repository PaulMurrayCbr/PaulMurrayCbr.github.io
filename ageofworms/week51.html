<p>
And so, with a part of the spirit of Balakarde accompanying, our heroes set off across the wormcrawl fissure to find the next bit. But first! A wandering monster! A mindkiller scorpion senses the party and moves to attack, but Flash takes care of it with a couple of maximised Bolts of Glory. This becomes important in a minute.
</p><p>
<div class="sidel"><div class="sideh">
Thessalar’s Fortress</div>
This pinnacle of rock soars nearly 2,000feet above the surrounding canyon floor,yet remains nearly an equal distance fromthe rim above. An immense bridge of stoneconnects the top of this spire to the canyonrim about 3,000 feet to the west, the steepslope of this bridge featuring well-wornstairs to aid descents from above to thismesa. The mesa itself is caught in a disorientingzone between near-constant layers ofclouds above and below, giving it an otherworldlyfeel. Perched on the eastern edge ofthis mesa is a strange, squat fortress madeof red marble, its low walls smooth and polished.There are few sharp corners on thiskeep, giving it an almost organic look.
</div>
<div class="img300">
<img src="images/WCF-Thessalhydra.jpg">
<b>Thessalhydra</b><hr>A four-legged, pincer-tailed, thirty-five footlong monster lumbers into view witha rumbling, bone-shaking roar. The beastis red with a darker orange underbelly, andlooks vaguely draconic in shape save that inplace of a head it has an enormous centralmaw surrounded by a ring of eight snakelikeheads.
</div>
Balakarde’s spirit informs the party that another fragment of his spirit lies within that fortress. The party send Elvis over to have a look. The fortress has an open yard, in which are a pair of stange monsters. The party decide to <i>Fly</i> in, under cover of a <i>Invisibility Sphere</i>, and beat the crap out of them. Flash will take one, everyone else, the other.
</p><p class="smaller">
I screwed this up: these creatures are abberations, not undead, and Flash’s <i>Bolt of Glory</i> should not have been as effective as it was.
</p><p>
<div class="img300">
<img src="images/WCF-Thessalar.png">
The current tenant of the fortress isan ancient world-traveling lich namedThessalar. Long obsessed with the miracleof life, Thessalar ironically turned toundeath as a way to continue his disturbingand often monstrous experimentsinto the nature of the living organism.The architect of numerous monstrouscreations in his time, Thessalar claimsauthorship of dozens of magical beasts including thechuul, the owlbear, the grick, the rustmonster, and the mimic, although hisclaims for some of these monsters aredoubtful at best.</div>
Well, Flash drops two <i>Maximized Bolts of Glory</i> into his, killing it very dead. The party begin beating up the other. Then a figure pops into view - unmistakably a lich. This lich calls “Stop! Stop this fighting! Who are you, and why do you disurb my work?”. As he does so, the monster that they were fighting backs down.
</p><p>
Flash, of course takes the initiative. They are looking for a fragment of soul (And why not be honest? They are going to kill him anyway.). Thesallar replies that he knows of this  soul fragment, and will give it to the party if they will <strike>fetch hime a shrubbery</strike> perform a simple quest. Mend and Frith note two things of note:
<ol><li>Mend notes that the Lich is actually an image, no doubt via a <i>Project Image</i> spell. This spell requires line-of-sight.</li>
<li>Frith notes that the Lich is <em>definitely</em> lying and this sould business is news to him. He simply wants a quest done, and has no intention of honouring his end of the bargain.</li></ol>
</p><p>
Flash asks the nature of the quest. The lich requires that another resident of the fissure, a beautiful winged snake-woman who lives to the south in a tower shaped like a claw,  be brought to him alive. Alive! He only wants to talk to her, it seems, but she refuses to see him.
</p><p>
The party go into a huddle. The lich is obviously inside the not-very-large fort, projecting the image through a window, so they decide to go etheral, walk through the walls, and clobber him.
</p><div class="divbreak">&mdash;&nbsp;&dagger;&nbsp;&mdash;</div><p>
So they go etheral. And walk through the walls. Thessalar sees them do it, and readies an action. When Frith dismisses the spell, he lets loose a <i>Wail of the Banshee</i>.
</p><p>
Well. Some of our heroes have a <i>Death Ward</i> in effect. Gauthkan is not present (he has exchanged places for the night with a monk in a red shirt).
</p><div style="margin: 1em; padding: 0 1em; border: thick solid black;"><p>
But Screechy &hellip; well, Screechy fails his save. Big time. And dies.</p><p>Let us pause a moment, then, to remember the life and times of this innocent owlbear. Cruelly orphaned while still a chick, raised by Frith and granted awakening by kindly druids, ferocious barbarian, grappler of dragons. Felled by a Lich, with a ninth-level spell.</p><p>
Farewell, brave Screechy, and Rest in Peace.
</p></div>
<p>
Gauthkan’s comic relief also cops it.
</p><p>
Thessalar then uses a <i>Quickened Wall of Force</i> to protect himself from the cleric, leaving himself and Mend behind it.
</p><p>
Then, in a classic team play, Flash dispells the wall of force, and Frith Greater Turns the Lich, rolling well and destroying him.
</p><div class="divbreak">&mdash;&nbsp;&dagger;&nbsp;&mdash;</div><p class="smaller">
</p><div class="img300">
<b>Out-Of-Game info</b><hr>
Ifdestroyed, Thessalar’s spirit returns to his phylactery kept in a distant lair hundredsof miles away, and turns hisattentions elsewhere. He’s survived forhundreds of years, and in that span hasbeen defeated no fewer than six times—he does not make a habit of returningfor revenge against foes that have alreadyproven their ability to defeat him, especiallysince he has duplicate copies of hisspellbooks at his hidden true lair.
</div>
The party loot, recovering some good shit including a <i>Glove of Storing</i> with a <i>Portable Hole</i> in it which, contrary to all known physical laws, has not ripped a hole through to the astral plane. Then they turn their attention to the thingy that the lich was working on.
</p><p>
The thingy is a cylindrical force wall (nothing so crude as a cauldron, when you are a 20th level caster) containing a writhing mass of body parts. It seems the lich was working on perfecting his aberrations. Our heroes drop the force wall, and the contents promptly form themselves into a monster like the ones out in the courtyard, but a little meaner.
</p><p>
But once again, in a splendid team play, Flash casts <i>Slime Wave</i>, and Frith casts <i>Repulsion</i>. Although the creature recovers from ordinary battle damage at a ferocious rate, green slime is another matter altogether and 
there is nothing needing doing but to watch it dissolve. Unfortunately, this creature also spits acid, a big gob of the stuff badly corroding Flash’s and Frith’s shiny armour. Hopefully Mend will have a chance to fix it.
</p><p>
And as the monster irrevocably dissolves into goo, the spirit haunting it opts instead to haunt one of Flash’s dragonshards. Interestingly, this spirirt fragment is quite diferent from the other. The fragment haunting the purse is Balakarde’s thirst to know, his scholarly side. But Balakarde was more than a scholar - he was a fighter, a deadly campaigner and veteran of a score of adventures. More, he was implacably determined to bring a halt to the Age of Worms, to slay Dragotha. It is this side of him - Balakarde the Slayer - that haunted the raging chaos of the Lich’s work, which now haunts the dragonshard. It also gives advice to the bearer - mainly “Look Out” (+4 initiative).
</p><p>
There is little else of interest in here. The final part of Balakarde’s spirit is “tahtaway”.
</p>
<div class="divbreak">&mdash;&nbsp;&dagger;&nbsp;&mdash;</div>
<p class="smaller">Well! One bit remains! What happens when you complete the set? Or will our party go the old “Screw this, let’s just charge off and get killed by Dragotha!”? As always, till next week!</p>
