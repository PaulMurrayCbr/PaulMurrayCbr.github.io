<h1 align="center">Age of Worms</h1>
<p>Since the beginning of history, humanity has measured time in ages.
Ages of glory, of Dreams, and even of Great Sorrows mark the human
tally of the years, giving a sense of order to the events of past
centuries. But one age has yet to occur, an age of darkness, of decay,
and of writhing doom. Witty bards and wrathful preachers know it as the
Age of Worms, weaving it into the peripheries of their passion plays as
a mythic era of destruction that could begin at any time. Astrologers,
diviners, and servants of the fates know more. The canniest among them
fear that the Age of Worms has already begun.</p>
