<h3>Week 35 - All the way in</h3>
<div>
<p class="smaller">
This page covers week 35 and part of week 36. Jericho turns out to be an Heir of Syberris - House Orien. Meaning that he can <i>Greater Teleport</i> once per day. With Flash using <i>Clairvoyance</i> and <i>Rary’s Telepathic Bond</i>, this makes many obstacles less formidiable.   
</p>

With the worms kept at bay with Frith’s “Repel Vermin” spell, the party looks around. To the east is a corridor ending in a door. The party elect to go thataway.

7. Temple of the 
Fountain
</div>
This chamber is lined with the trappings of 
religious ceremony in homage to Kyuss the 
Wormgod, but in place of an altar stands a 
beautiful if disturbing fountain carved from 
black marble. 
</div>
<div class="visionr"><p align="center">
<B>Vision: Apotheosis</B>
</p>
The immediate surroundings waver and 
fade, replaced by a bird’s-eye view of the city 
of Kuluth-Mar at its height. The streets are 
empty, as the thousands of citizens seem to 
have gathered in a mass in the central plaza 
surrounding the Spire of Long Shadows. 
Suddenly, a foul energy wells from the spire 
at the center of the city, sweeping outward 
and felling the living as it passes. For each 
creature that falls, you feel a silent but potent 
sense of wrongness, as some indescribable 
part of the creature, perhaps its soul, is drawn 
back toward the Spire of Long Shadows to 
be absorbed by the strange black monolith 
of stone balanced at its peak. As the energy 
builds around the peak, a shimmering image 
of a colossal humanoid ﬁgure, its body composed of a million writhing worms, takes 
form around the Spire of Long Shadows, 
its arms raised in triumph. Yet in another 
moment, that triumphant pose seems to 
change to one of rage, and a soul-wrenching 
cry of fury tears from the undulant face. The
image shrinks, pulled into the stone monolith at the Spire’s peak, imploding with a horriﬁc wet burst. In an instant, the city is quiet 
again, yet as the vision fades, the ﬁrst signs of 
unlife spread through the thousands of dead 
bodies strewn around the ziggurat’s base as 
bodies, now festering with green worms rise 
from death. 
</div>

Within is a fountain of water, and three wormcallers. They immediately throw enchantments at the party members, suggesting that they “drink”. Jericho and Gauthakan are ensnared, but Frith and Flash keep their wits. Flash manages to free the two from the suggestion (in Gauthakan’s case, by <i>dominating</i> him), but the melee is complicated by the wormswarms which, althogh they cannot approach Frith, nevertheless move around the border of his spell’s emanation, looking for a weakness. Though Flash manages to free Jericho from the <i>Suggestion</i>, by the time he does so, Jericho has moved close to the fountain itself and fallen under sway of its powerful compulsion. As the battle rages, Jericho drinks. And swallows a mouthful of Kyuss worms. And experiences yet another vision:

</p><p>
Jericho is not quick enough to spit out all the worms, and one starts burrowing toward his brain. But Frith (or Flash) makes use of the holy symbol of the Silver Flame that was given to them long ago, and the work is destroyed.
</p><p class="smaller">
The Holy Symbol is mechanically a wand of <i>Remove Curse</i>. I made it a symbol of the Silver Flame for flavour reasons. Flash uses it, as Frith does not worship the flame. At the time, Frith’s buddies gave him a few potions of <i>Remove Disease</i>, which also will get rid of a burrowing Kyuss worm.

<div class="sidel"><div class="sideh">
11. Sea of Worms
</div>
This immense cavern is ﬁlled with a horriﬁc 
sea of writhing green and the nauseating 
susurrus of millions of slimy bodies slithering over each other. There is no ﬂoor - the 
hallway falls away to the undulating surface 
of an immense lake of green worms. The 
rippling surface lies about five feet down 
from the ﬂoor of the passageway, while the 
ceiling rises to a vault nearly ninety feet 
above. Low islands of stone protrude here 
and there from the wormy expanse, and 
additional passageways extend out of the 
sea and back onto solid ground in the wall 
opposite and in the walls to the left and 
the right. 
</div>

<div class="sidel"><div class="sideh">
8. East Chamber of 
the Long Sleep </div>
Perfectly preserved corpses cover most 
of this large chamber’s floor, arrayed 
head-to-toe in neat rows. Thick dust 
obscures the walls and floors, signs of 
the room’s great age, yet no trace of 
decay touches the corpses. The massive 
green stone blocks that line the chamber 
are covered with ancient symbols resem- 
bling coiling worms. 
</div>

<div class="sidel"><div class="sideh">
9. West Chamber of 
the Long Sleep 
</div>
Dozens of skeletons lie on the ﬂoor here, 
neatly arranged on the ground and sur- 
rounded by halos of stonework stained with 
ancient decay. 
</div>
After the wormcallers are defeated, he party deals with those annoying wormswarms. One is chased to the south, where it joins the great Sea of Worms. The others are chased to the west. The party elect to ignore the sea of worms, or now, and pass through the sleeping chambers, electing to leave the corpses undisturbed. Then they turn south.
</p><div class="divbreak">&mdash;&nbsp;&dagger;&nbsp;&mdash;</div><p>
<div class="sidel"><div class="sideh">
10. Chamber of 
Contemplation 
</div>
Nests of tattered books, bits of fabric, and 
other refuse lie scattered about the chamber, curved troughs each big enough to ﬁt 
a worm the size of a small horse. There’s 
a disconcerting symmetry to the way the 
nests are positioned in the room, a marker 
of an alien will making itself at home amid 
the refuse of Kyuss’ arrogance and power.</div>

Jericho enters the room, but is spotted by Sruggut, the worm naga residing in this room. But rather than attack, the naga exclaims “Outsiders? Here? Do you know how to teleport?”. The party elect to talk with this strange creature. Frith takes the precation of, under their momentary truce, casting <i>Zone of Truth</i>.
</p><p>
It transpires that Sruggut has been here since the fall of the city.  It (or “he”, if you like)  was one of Kyuss’ spellcasters. 
For millennia, he has been studying the books of magic located in the spire and the surrounding buildings within the Obsidian Ring for the secret of teleportation.
<blockquote>
“All these books concern necromancy. Do you desire to know how to remove a still-beating heart and replace it with a stone? It’s that volume over there - “On Circulation”. Would you care to know how to strip the flesh from a living being, and draw out the process for weeks or months of torment? Third from the bottom: “Handy tips for torturers - intermediate level”. But the simplest spell to create light? Or levitate? Not a word of it in any of these. Useless! Useless!”.
</blockquote>
<p>The party agree to teleport Sruggut out of the ring, on condition that he be handed over to the mage Manzorian. Thus he exchanges one prison for another, if possibly a more congenial one.
</p><p>
In response to questions as to why he has not aged, Sruggut replies that he is not undead, it is simply that his flesh does not age as other things do. As to the two rooms of the long sleep, he explains that the corpses were kept for experiments, but the spell on one of the rooms failed ages ago. The party asks “what spells can you cast”, and he answers that his spells are necromantic - he knows spells for creating death instantly in another, for preserving corpses, and sundry other things. He answers questions about what else is in the complex. He warns the party about the fountain, and tells them that three of the four knights of Kyuss live opposite the Sea of Worms, patiently waiting for the Age of Worms. But as to what is south of the Sea, he adresses Frith:
<blockquote>
“I will tell you what is to the south, but you - you, godman - swear to me! Swear it by your gods, by all that you hold holy, that you will do as you have promised, that you will get me out of here!”
</blockquote>

</p><p class="smaller">
A bit of a moral dilemma for the party. Table-talk compared this Sruggut character to a Nazi war-criminal/scientist that potentially had valuable knowledge. So they decided to dump it in Manzorian’s lap. Hmm&hellip; . Sruggut has not aged, of course, because he is an abberation and not a natural creature. As to his spells, he can cast “Finger of Death”, but that doesn’t mean that he knows what it’s supposed to be called.
</p><p>
Frith swears by his Chaotic-Good gods (Hmm&hellip;) that the party will do as promised, and Sruggut reveals his final secret:
</p><blockquote>
“Kyuss did not learn is arts alone. There was another - one of an ancient race called the spellweavers - who taught him. That one lives yet, in a chamber to the south of the great sea.”
</blockquote><p>
Sruggut will provide no help in dealing with the Knights or the spellweaver. His fear of them is obvious. The party discuss what to do. Flash uses <i>Shadow Walk</i> to get the party to the surface. It seems that overnight, jericho has grown an aberrant dragonmark. And <em>what</em> a dragonmark! The mark of house Orien covers his whole body, from head to toe, and he has become able to peform a <i>Greater Teleport</i> once per day. They hatch a plan.

<div class="sidel"><div class="sideh">
12. The Knights of the 
Worm </div>
This room seems out of place, given the cold 
and barren decor of the other chambers in 
the complex. The ﬂoor is covered with a thick 
green carpet, and a long, padded divan sits 
in the room’s center. Small padded stools 
surround the divan. The walls are carved 
with nightmarish scenes of a dual world. 
The lower half of these carvings depict a 
world of caverns and twisting tunnels that 
are infested with massive worms, creatures 
that look like humans posing as worms, 
and creatures more horrifying than either. 
On the upper half, these worm monsters 
burst from the ground to ravage and ruin 
numerous 
humanoid civilizations. Dragons with 
the heads of worms ﬂy in the skies above, 
and towering over them all is an immense 
ﬁgure dressed in plate armor and wielding a strange pole-arm that combines the 
features of a pick, an axe, and a mace. The 
man’s face is hidden by the hood of his 
dark gray robe, but worms drip from under 
his cowl. 
</div>

Next day, they spider-climb down the shaft, as before. Flash uses <i>Clairvoyance</i> to scout out the knights room, and Jericho teleports the party in. Silently, they deal wit one knight. Then Flash uses <i>Wall of Force</i> to hold the other at bay, while they deal with the second Knight. Then they do the third, and that’s that. Then they <i>Shadow Walk</i> to the surface again.
</p><p class="smaller">
Royally pissing off their DM in the process. Those knights are supposed to be a tough fight. Its not nearly as bad as what happens next, though.

<div class="sidel"><div class="sideh">
13. The Harbinger</div>
This chamber, opulent by nearly any standard, seems somehow alien despite its finery. Furniture placed at odd and uncomfortable angles blends with the disconcerting 
imagery of the carpets and tapestries that 
decorate the room. This imagery is some- 
times understandable, depicting scenes 
of carnage and torture in great detail and 
in other places is simply abstract patterns 
drawn by an alien and unsettled mind. 
</div>
<div class="visionr"><p align="center"><B>
Vision: The Age of Worms</B></p>

The room melts away into darkness as the 
air ﬁlls with strange and frightening whispers. It sounds as if a hundred diﬀerent 
voices speak in a hundred diﬀerent languages, but an instant later, the voices have 
joined into one and the language resolves 
into familiar words. These words speak of 
the prophecies of the Age of Worms, and as 
they speak, visions of the prophecies coming true manifest before you, allowing you 
to observe the events as if you were a god 
looking down upon a troubled world. The 
visions are violent and horriﬁc. Legions of 
worm-eaten dead rise from soggy graves. 
An immense and demonic tree explodes 
into destructive life from the heart of an 
unfamiliar city. A burning comet lances 
down from the heavens to strike the earth 
in a tremendous, mushroom-shaped cloud 
of devastation. Another city, its town square 
wreathed in a cloud of black smoke ﬁlled 
with eyes, is held in the grip of shadows 
that move independently from their source. 
A cackling man attaches a clawed and withered hand to the bleeding stump of his 
arm, and the hand writhes into unholy life. 
A city built in the heart of a volcano suﬀers 
tragedy during a partial eruption that sees 
the collapse of its southeastern quadrant. 
As each of these scenes ﬂash by, they are 
accompanied by a crushing sense of certainty—these events have already come 
to pass. Yet ﬁnally, the whispering voices 
speak of two more prophecies, and these 
are accompanied by blackness. “A tripartite 
spirit once again becomes one, and at its 
advice are the mighty undone,” the voices 
whisper. And then, “On the eve of the Age 
of Worms, a hero of the pit shall use his 
fame to gift a city to the dead.” After this, 
there is only silence. It would seem that two 
prophecies have yet to be realized. 
</div>
Next day, they do the same thing, but with the spellweaver, teleporting in right on top of him. The Harbinger of the age of Worms gets one spell off - <i>Repulsion</i>, against which everyone but Frith saves. Gauthakan does a surprise attack, then Gauthacan and Jericho both get full-round attacks (Jericho using <i>Gravestrike</i>). The harbinger of the age of worms is toast. Then they have a vision.
</p><p>
And, that’s it. There is a “thump” that reverberates through the ground. Outside, they discover that all the worms in the sea of worms are dead. There are two wormcallers, that they deal with, and they pick up Zruggut. Outside, they find that the great spire has fallen and crashed through the Obsidian Ring, shattering it. But with the death of the Harbinger, the link of Kyuss to this place is gone. It’s just an old ruin, now.
</p><p>
They teleport back to Manzorian. He has some news.
