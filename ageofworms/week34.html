<h3>Week 34 - Handling the shaft</h3>

1. Western Entrance
</div>
The walls of this chamber are carved
to depict an army of armored soldiers
engaged in the ruin and destruction of a
city of helpless men, women, and children.
Buildings burn, blood washes the streets,
and dark thunderclouds boil in the skies
above. Above them all, directing the army,
is an enormous figure dressed in plate
mail. His face is cold and cruel, but also
quite handsome. He wields an exotic polearm
that combines the features of a pick,
an axe, and a mace.
</div>

The party examine the western entrance cautionsly, but there isn't much there.

5. Halls of Knowledge
</div>
This long chamber obviously served as a
library, as dozens of bookshelves line the
walls and stand back-to-back amid the
chamber. In addition to the surprisingly
well-preserved tomes, twelve clear jars sit
on various shelves, each filled with a thin
gray liquid and containing a single writhing
green worm.
</div>
Then the party venture the southern door. Behind it is a library, and three more foes: two undead knights, and some sort of spellcaster. 
</p>

<div class="visionr"><p align="center">
<B>Vision: Kyuss the
Student
</B></p>
The chamber wavers and shimmers, and
suddenly a human man appears at one of
the desks nearby. A strange gray-skinned
humanoid creature with six arms stands
at his shoulder. The man studies a collection
of worn and pitted bronze disks
arrayed on the desk before him. Faint
etchings adorn the plates, and it seems
as if the alien figures and symbols writhe
together at the behest of some sinister
will. The gray creature points to one of
the plates, and a look of sudden comprehension
blooms on the man’s face. The
man, the creature, and the plates then
fade away, and are gone.
</div>
They fight and defeat these three, and experience yet another vision.
</p>

<div class="visionr"><p align="center">
Vision: The Sundering
</p>
The strange dark stain in the air wavers and
then grows solid. The peak of the Spire of
Long Shadows is restored, and affixed to
this peak is a fifteen-foot-tall, three-foot-thick
trapezoid-shaped pinnacle of black
rock, ten feet wide at the base and five at the
peak. The monolith of stone shimmers and
vibrates with waves of energy, and something
strange and horrible writhes inside
its nearly opaque interior. Suddenly, a brilliant
red wall of scales fills the view, and
there’s a terrible sound of crumbling stone.
In an instant, an enormous red dragon is
winging away to the north. The spire’s peak
is in ruins, and clutched in the dragon’s talons
is the monolith. The vision fades, and
the dragon and its prize are gone.
</div>
The party search the room, taking a dozen flasks with Kyuss worms in them, worms that can grant knowlege ... but at a price. Jericho examines the stairs up out of the central chamber, and determines that they open up onto hidden entrances in the outside of the ziggurat. He, too, notices the strange stain in the air. Flash attempts to determine its nature with a <i>Clairvoyance</i> spell, but finds nothing. So Jericho agrees to climb the spire. Near the top, he experiences another vision, which the party shares by their <i>Rary's telepathic bond</i>.

</p>

<div class="divbreak">&mdash;&nbsp;&dagger;&nbsp;&mdash;</div>
<p>
The party decide to rest before attempting the climb down the shaft in the centre of the main chamber. Their researches in the library indicated that below them were the private chambers of Kuss, and those of the four "Knights of Kyuss". Serious foes, no doubt. The grounds around the ziggurat turn out to be infested with worms, so they cross the barrier to camp outside. 
</p>
<p>

6. The Writhing
Chamber 
</div>
At first, the floor itself seems writhe and
twist in on itself, but a longer look reveals
it to be covered with thousands and thousands
of Kyuss worms of all sizes.
</div>
But first, Flash uses <i>Clairvoyance</i> again to determine what lies at the foot of the shaft. It turns out to be a room full of Kyuss worms. This causes consternation. Various approaches are suggested, but Frith recalls that the worms are merely vermin and not themselves undead. Forewarned is forearmed, so he announces that he will beseech his gods to grant him the spell of <i>Repel Vermin</i>. Maybe a couple.

Next day, the party rise and are soon ready to dare the shaft. With a <i>Hero's Feast</i> and <i>Spider Climb</i> all around, they descend. The walls of the shaft are honeycombed with passages, and three strange nagas attack. They dispel he Spider Climbing on Frith and Jericho, but our heroes have rings of Feather Fall. Frith elects to cast his Repel Vermin and simply drift to the bottom. Flash and Gauthkan, with Feeblemind and hammer respectively destroy the strange nagas.

As our adventure concludes for the nonce, the party stand in a room filled with kyuss worms, with a 10'-wide clear area centered on Frith.
