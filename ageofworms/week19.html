<h3>Week 19 - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Friends-Influence-People-Revised/dp/067142517X">How to win friends and influence people</a>, and the party takes a flutter. </h3>
<p class="smaller">A shorter session this week, getting a fair bit of roleplaying out of the way (which perhaps gives you some idea of our style of play). Andrew - the Beguiler's alter-ego -  was not present, and so the social interaction simply came down to dice rolls. Which is good for me, as I am no actor.</p>
<p class="smaller">We have rewound time a bit, back to Eligos' debriefing session with the party. This is my fault, as I did not read this next module before running the end of the last one. Turns out quite a bit more happened at that dinner than we thought last session.
</p>
<p>
<div class="sider">
&ldquo;Good evening, my friends! I trust you 
brought your appetites? I tend to eat dinner as I get the chance, and I hope this 
somewhat informal repast doesn&rsquo;t offend 
you. Good, I thought not. In any event, 
let&rsquo;s eat - after dinner, I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ve 
learned of your little green worms.&rdquo;
</div>

A day or two after defeating Zyrxog and discovering that his employer is none other than director of the Champions Games and all-around civic pillar Loris Raknian, Eligos sends word to the party inviting them to dinner. The party attend.
</p>
<div class="divbreak"></div>

<p>
Eligos delivers a mini lecture, covering the following points:

<ul>
<li> 

<div class="sider">
<div class="sideh">Kyuss</div>
 In Eberron, Kyuss is a wizard born in Sarlona over two thousand years 
ago, who was driven to Khorvaire by those who 
feared his dark magics. He established a city 
in the region now known as Q&rsquo;barra, where he 
continued his study of necromancy. But Kyuss 
was not content with mortal magic. He learned 
of an ancient power of undeath: Katashka the 
Gatekeeper, one of the overlords of the Age of 
Demons. Kyuss pledged himself to Katashka 
and learned his terrible secrets, including the 
creation of worm-infested spawn. Ultimately 
Kyuss sought to become a physical vessel for 
Katashka&rsquo;s power, and he sacrificed his city of 
followers to accomplish this task. But somewhere along the way he had miscalculated, by 
joining his soul to the spirit of Katashka, he 
bound himself into the demon&rsquo;s prison. Kyuss 
had doomed himself for eternity. </div>

All of these clues point to the involvement of an ancient Sarlonian wizard called Kyuss. According to the stories, Kyuss was bound and trapped forever along with his patron, Katashka. That his doom might not be a thorough as previously thought is cause for great alarm.
</li><li>
 The worm-infested undead are the 
most notorious (and the least dangerous) of Kyuss&rsquo; spawn. Their presence in 
the region, combined with the discovery of the various worms, indicates that 
the cult of Kyuss is certainly becoming 
more active in the area. Spawn of Kyuss 
are especially dangerous in that they are 
horrifically fecund. 
</li><li>
The cult of Kyuss has traditionally been 
small, often consisting of single priests 
who live double lives as upstanding citizens. Recent evidence suggests that the 
Ebon Triad may have involved the smaller 
(but older) cult of Kyuss in its schemes. 
Eligos suspects some dark purpose 
behind this sinister alliance, possibly 
related to the coming Age of Worms. 
</li><li>
Tales of the Age of Worms itself are as 
old as anything. Often known by other 
names (the End Times, The Dark Age, 
and the Eternal Ruin among others), 
the Age of Worms is an ancient set of 
prophecies that speak of a transformation of the world, of a time when 
life gives way to something else. These 
prophecies are recorded in certain 
rare texts like the Book of Vile Darkness, 
Libris Mortis, the Necronomicon, and 
the Apostolic Scrolls, and are inscribed 
on the walls of ancient ruins across 
the world. Many cults and soothsayers have developed their own theories 
about the Age of Worms, but Eligos 
has never seen so many references to 
it from so many different sources as 
the information the PCs provide him. 
Something is certainly building. 
</li></ul>
</p>

<p>
At the mention of the Apostolic Scrolls, the party
<p class="smaller">completely drop the ball. Massive clue linking the Age of Worms to the Apostolic Scrolls and thereby to the last two or three months of DnD, but no - they're waaay too busy discussing PrCs to be listening to plot exposition. Eventually they get the idea. Yes, choo-choo and all aboard and all that.</p>
the party perk up and relate their recent adventures and the involvement of Loris Raknian. 
</p>

<p>
Well. Eligos is very concerned that a) anything as horribly evil and dangerous as the Apostolic Scrolls should be in town and b) that a prominient citizen such as Loris Raknian would have anything to do with them. The Apostolic Scrolls are reputed to have been written by Kyuss himself, and among other things detail the creation of the ulgurstatsa - massive undead that consume the living and regurgitate them as undead. The scrolls are said to contain rituals that allow an ulgurstatsa to create even more powerful undead.
</p>

<p>
Raknian is simply untouchable at this juncture. A prominent, powerful and well-liked citizen of Sharn. His note to Zyrxog is simply not enough evidence to damn him. The party will need to investigate, and the best way to do that is probably to get into the Champion's Games. Trickier than it sounds.
</p>

<p>
The Champion's Games is a ten-day competition, featuring a variety of athletic events - chariot and foot racing, various styles of combat and wrestling, archery and the like, and full gladiatorial combat - team and individual, against monsters and against other gladiators. It is as part of this last style of event that a group of unknowns can walk in off the street and compete. Well: more or less. You do need to have a licensed manager, and licenses are difficult (and expensive) to come by. Luckily, Eligos has a friend. Her name is Celeste. 
</p>
<div class="divbreak">&mdash;&nbsp;&dagger;&nbsp;&mdash;</div>
<img src="images/CB-Celeste.png" align="left"/>
<img src="images/CB-EkaymSmallcask.png" align="right"/>
<p>
Celeste meets the party at The Crooked House, and brings with her an acquaintance, one Ekaym Smallcask - some sort of bard. Ekaym is a manager looking for a team, and the party are a team looking for a manager. The usual split of the winnings is 50/50, but flash manages to beat Ekaym down to 30%. Celeste leaves.
</p>
<p class="smaller">Celeste is an NPC from the <a href="http://paizo.com/dungeon/products/issues/shackledCity" target="Paizo">Shackled City</a>.   At this stage, she plays no further part as far as the party knows.
</p>
<p>Ekaym explains the rules of the competition. 
</p>
<div class="divbreak"></div>

<div style="background-color: #cef; font-family: sans-serif">

<div class="sider"><div class="sideh">Rules of Battle</div>
 All battles are potentially lethal, but 
a gladiator always has the option of 
surrender. To surrender, a gladiator 
must drop his weapons, kneel, and 
hold both hands in the air. A gladiator who attacks a surrendering foe is 
immediately disqualified (and likely 
arrested for assault or murder). A 
gladiator who surrenders and then 
attacks another gladiator is also 
immediately disqualified.
<hr>
Gladiators that can fly or levitate may 
do so up to a height of 40 feet. A 
gladiator that flies any higher is disqualified. Burrowing into the arena's 
floor is forbidden. 
<hr>
A match persists until one team is victorious, either through the death or 
the surrender of all opposing teams. 
<hr>
Winning gladiators have no right to 
the spoils of the fallen. A defeated 
gladiator keeps his gear, or in the case 
of death, ownership of gear reverts to 
his team or manager. 
<hr>
Any tactic that endangers spectators is 
grounds for immediate disqualification and possible legal action. 
<hr>
A disqualified gladiator must cease 
fighting at once and must move to the 
edge of the field of battle immediately. 
Failure to comply results in the disqualification of the entire team. Once a 
gladiator is disqualified, he may no longer take part in any remaining battles. 
<hr>
Awards are given after each battle.
</div>
<p>
The gladiatorial 
games consist 
of a massive four-round 
elimination event spaced over the ten days of the games. A single team 
can consist of no more than 
eight members. Familiars 
do not count as members, 
but larger animal companions, mounts, and cohorts do. 
Each team of gladiators 
must identify itself with a name and 
designate a leader. 
</p>
<p>

 The tournament is fought in 
four successive rounds of 
elimination. <br>The first 
round consists of six 
battles of free-for-all combat between 
groups of four 
teams. <br> In the second round, the six 
winners of the first 
round of battles 
are paired off into 

three team-versus-team battles. <br>In the third round, two of the three 
remaining teams fight each other, while the 
third team fights a special exhibition match 
against an exotic monster. Traditionally, this exhibition match is fought by the current holder of the Champion&rsquo;s Belt (if they have made it through to round three). <br>The fourth and 
final round is a face-to-face battle between 
the two remaining teams. 
</p><p>
 The winner of 
each round is awarded a generous prize to 
be shared among the team members and 
their manager. 
</p><p>

 The first day of the Champion&rsquo;s Games 
begins with the Free Dinner, a sumptuous 
outdoor banquet held on the battleground of 
the arena itself at sundown. The Free Dinner 
involves hundreds of people and is open to 
Loris Raknian and his retinue, the licensed 
managers, the gladiators, and the most affluent among the Free City's nobility. Wagers 
are placed as the nobles have the opportunity to meet the gladiators and evaluate their 
might and commeasure the first bets. 
</p><p>
 After the Free Dinner, the gladiators 
are escorted to a huge chamber 
below the arena. This is the Coenoby 
(pronounced see-no-bie), and it is home 
for the gladiators until their elimination 
from the competition or the end of the 
Games. During the time the gladiators are 
confined to the Coenoby, they are allowed 
meetings with their managers every other 
day. Any team not responding to a fight's 
roll call or found guilty of violating any 
rules of the tournament is immediately 
disqualified and expelled from the Coenoby by Raknian's elite guards. 
</p>
</div>
<p>
The party agree and sign the forms.    
In honour of the town of Diamond Lake where they met and began adventuring, they name themselves "Rough Diamond", and Flash unanimously appoints himself team leader. 
They are now gladiators, participants in the Champion's Games of Sharn. Whoopee! Ekaym meet the party at sign-up day, in a week or so.
</p>
<div class="divbreak">&mdash;&nbsp;&dagger;&nbsp;&mdash;</div>



<p>
<span class="sidel"><div class="sideh">Hareth's Folly, Middle Dura</div>
The buildings of this district are a bizarre mishmash of architectural styles and materials. Narrow spires stand across from squat brick keeps and densewood halls. In addition to the bridges connecting the great towers of the district, a maze of suspended rope, wood, and stone roads connect the upper levels within the towers, creating the impression of a mad spider web. Music and song can be heard echoing from the various towers, and people laugh and run through the streets.
</span>
The arena is an enormous hollow tower in Hareth's Folly. The party meet Ekaym and register with no difficulty. Then it's time to attend the free dinner - so called because anyone may attend, well - in theory. In practice, it's a very select event attended by, if not the cream of Sharn society, certainly the cream of a certain segment of Sharn society. Has-been gladiators, famous entertainers, the sporting rich, and the bookies.
</p>
<p>
<img src="images/CB-LorisRaknian.png" align="right">
But first, Raknian. The party locate him without difficulty - he is sitting at the head table. Frith determines that he does indeed register their presence, but for now the gloves are still on. He makes no move, and neither does the party. Instead, the party look for a bookie. Gambling on yourself is positively encouraged, and in no time each party member manages to place 250gp at 3:1 odds. Flash looks for a bookie that will handle more, but has no luck. Their manager, Ekaym, is a little distracted and not really on the job - he seems to be watching Raknian, too. A <i>Detect Thoughts</i> spell indicates that he suspects Raknian of doing him a grave and personal wrong. There is a woman's name, but Flash can get no more at this time.
</p>
<p>
There are some familiar faces at the free dinner. In particular, the current holder of the Champion's Belt is none other than Auric, leader of that band of adventurers who <a href="week1.html">first set the party on the path of graverobbing for loot</a>. Khellek is with him, but where is Tiarra? A question soon answered, as the lady herself approaches them. She believes that the party might very well defeat Auric, Khellek, and The Leatherworks - their flesh golems - and offers a deal. If the party will promise to show mercy should they be victorious, she will act as agent for a hefty wager of 2,500 gold. As to why she herself is not competing, she replies: "brawling with gladiators is bad for business".  
</p>
<p>
And that's about it for the free dinner. The gladiators are lowered to the under-arena level, and from there descend a long winding staircase into the foundations of the towers of Dura, to a great chamber called 'The Coenoby' which shall be their home for the next ten days, or until they are defeated or disqualified.
</p>
<div class="divbreak">&mdash;&nbsp;&dagger;&nbsp;&mdash;</div>
<div class="sidel"><div class="sideh">The Coenoby</div>
 The Coenoby is unusually comfortable, 
smoothly floored, well-lit and warm, and 
outfitted with an underground stream of 
fresh water. Here the PCs are given one 
of the twenty-four underground lodges 
available to the gladiators. The 
place is very crowded, but everyone knows 
that the number of gladiators is going to 
drop to one sixth by the end of the following day, so nobody worries too much. 
 Numerous Arena Wardens patrol the 
Coenoby, their presence often being the 
only thing that keeps the peace. </div>
<p>
The roster for the first six battles is drawn and posted, and the intrigue begins. The three teams that Rough Diamond face in the first round are:
</p>
<p>
<strong>Arcane Auriga</strong> led by Rennida Auriga. This group of four elven archers are all female. Apart from that, and the fact that their team name mentions the word "arcane", nothing is obvious save that they are not looking for company.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Badlands Revenge</strong>, a group of three gnolls lead by some sort of human druid (the animal companion is a dead giveaway). These appear savage and unfriendly.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Sapphire Squad</strong>, who are tending their mounts, consist of two humans lead by a rarity - a regal looking humanoid named Korush who is plainly some sort of extraplanar visitor, although exactly what is not obvious. he seems charming an good-tempered.
</p>
<p>
Flash, the sly dog, goes for the elven chicks first. They are unfriendly, but Flash soon charms them. Not enough, however, that they agree to help. Pity.
</p>
<p>
Next Flash approaches Korush. He and Flash soon become best mates, and they agree to finish off the other two teams first. Furthermore, he offers to demonstrate to the party his unique fighting style. 
</p>



<div class="sider"><div class="sideh">Graceful&nbsp;Edge (feat)</div>
Choose one type of one-handed slashing 
melee weapon, such as a scimitar or longsword, for which you have already selected 
the Weapon Focus feat. You wield this 
weapon with an almost unnatural grace. <br>
 <b>Prerequisite</b>: Weapon Finesse, 
Weapon Focus (any one-handed slashing weapon), base attack bonus +1 <br>
 <b>Benefit</b>: If you do not wield a shield or 
weapon in your off-hand, you treat your 
chosen weapon as a light weapon. <br>
 If you do not wield a shield or weapon 
in your off-hand, you also gain a +1 shield 
bonus to your AC while wielding your 
chosen weapon. When you are Þghting 
defensively or using the total defense 
action, this shield bonus increases to +2. <br>
 <b>Special</b>: A fighter may select Graceful 
Edge as one of his Þghter bonus feats. <br>
 You may take this feat more than 
once - each time you do, it applies to a 
new one-handed slashing weapon you 
have Weapon Focus in. 
</div>

<p class="smaller">
Any party member who wishes may take "Graceful Edge" as a feat.
</p>

<p>
For his approach to Badlands Revenge, Flash opts to do a quick change. While he does so, Tom swings into action.
</p>

<p>Tom approaches the group, but they start out hostile, and Tom does not improve matters. Words are exchanged, including "half-pinkboy bastard" and "Look at you! You're not even a proper monster!". The marshals manage to persuade Tom and the gnolls to "save it for the arena" by threatening them with disqualification and expulsion, but at the end there are definite "Your ass is mine!" looks being shot between the two.
</p>

<p>Flash then approaches the gnolls disguised as something, but does not attempt to win them over. Instead, he uses the opportunity to study them. He then approaches Arcane Auriga and does a faultess imitation if a rude and hostile gnoll. Come tomorrow morning, that's who they will target first.
</p>

<p>
And so, to bed. Tomorrow is a big day.
</p>

<p class="smaller">
And that's how it stands. Come game night, we will essentially set up the board and start straight on melee. Should be a long and complicated battle. 
</p>
<p class="smaller">Cheers all! See you there.
