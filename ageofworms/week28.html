<h3>Week 28 - Mission accomplished!</h3>
<p>
<div class="sidel"><div class="sideh">3. The Hall of Poison Winds</div>
This tall, temple-like chamber has a forty foot-high ceiling. Carved stone pillars 
reach up to the ceiling in elegant lines, but 
strange clusters of spikes stick up from the 
ﬂoor in two distinct areas, like barricades. 
 Near the doors to the north, south, and 
east stand carved stone images of tall, 
elongated humanoid forms. A series of 
small openings, each about one inch in 
diameter, festoon the wall between these 
forms. Beneath these openings are small 
basins, each about the size of an apple. 
Strange undulations make the doors and 
nearby walls seem more like a curtain than 
a level surface. Twisting runes wind over 
the walls. The ﬂoor has channels carved 
in it, as if to transport water, but nothing 
ﬂows there now. 
</div>
<img src="images/Week28-Map1.png" align="right">
Our heroes move into the next room. The portal ghoul is here, cowering away from the holy presence of Frith. The sixth Belker is also here, flailing away uselessly at the ghoul. The party step in and carve them up. Then they retreat out of the room cautiously while Jericho investigates.
</p><p>
Jericho searches the room, but initially fails to locate any traps. Stepping confidently ahead to deal with one of the doors, he discovers that  it is indeed trapped.
<div class="sider"><div class="sideh">Bas-Relief movie</div>
When this vapor is created, it runs 
up along and melds with the bas-reliefs 
on the wall, generating a ﬂuid image that 
shows Icosiol at the battle of Pesh, ﬁghting 
twisted creatures of chaos. The last image is 
rendered in some detail, and depicts Icosiol 
forming an alliance with a powerful marut 
inevitable. At the end of the display, the 
gas fountains show Icosiol holding a large 
square seal in one hand and a long rod or 
staﬀ in the other, as if to display them to 
the viewer. 
</div>
 A thick misty gas seeps out of the holes in the wall, forming images of a Wind Duke in the cunningly crafted carvings on the wall and floor. This gas - perhaps intentionally, perhaps not - is poisonous, but Jerocho avoids any ill effects. Having seen one trap, he easily notes the location of the other two and sets about disabling them.
</p><p>
At around about this time, the south door opens, and standing in the door is seven-foot high red lizard, sumptuously dressed in finest asbestos, wielding a spear and whose form radiates incredible heat. Behind him stands   a huge-sized bonfire. "I say!", he exclaims, "What the devil is all this racket! And what business have you here? Explain yourselves!"
</p><p class="smaller">
Flash. Beguiler. Natch.
</p><p>
Jericho scurries out of the way, and Flash steps forward and respectfully addresses the fiery gentleman in Ignan. The gentleman is Antyress Redpike, Earl of Coalchester, and is horribly, horribly bored. He takes quite a shine to Flash, who assures him that they are merely attempting to rescue an old friend who had stumbled into the complex.
</p><p>
The Earl is quite content to let them continue, on promise that they will not loot the tomb or damage it. He warns them: "Down from here there is a room surrounded by pillars. Do be careful. To the north is a red river, whose banks at the moment are infested with Xorns. Crude things of earth, you know, barely more than beasts. To the south is the private room of the last keeper, Zifforan. He has gone quite mad, you know, and managed to transform himself into a wraith of some kind. Immensely dangerous. Now if you don't mind, I'm finding this room a little chilly. Charming to meet you." And with that, he retires south and west to his room.
</p><div class="divbreak">&mdash;&nbsp;&dagger;&nbsp;&mdash;</div><p>
The party decide to investigate the other doors. The door to the north turns out to be a false door set into bare rock. The door to the west opens onto a short corridor with double doors to the north. 
</p><p>
<div class="sidel"><div class="sideh">
4. Collapsing Pillar Hall</div>
This long hall contains a twin set of pillars, leading to a large set of doors at the 
far end. These are columns made of large 
marble blocks shaped like drums; not all 
have aged quite the same, so their colors 
vary from gray to white to tan. 
</div>

Jericho investigates, opens the doors, and discovers that the floor beyond the door to the north is trapped! He calls for Flash (or Frith), who identifies only that there is some kind of divination magic at work.
</p><p>
Jericho decides to trust his reflexes, and advances into the room. As soon as he does, a pillar falls on him! Or tries to. He leaps out of the way &hellip; and another pillar falls on him! But again, he nimbly dodges. The party decide to ignore the room, and search elsewhere.
</p><div class="divbreak">&mdash;&nbsp;&dagger;&nbsp;&mdash;</div><p>
<div class="sidel"><div class="sideh">
6. The Sword of Law</div>
This intersection is lit by six ﬂickering orange 
and yellow lanterns that ﬂoat around a central statue of grey stone. The statue shows 
an androgynous Wind Duke wearing robes 
that seem to be stirred by a breeze. The 
ﬁgure may be a symbol of justice or war, for 
it holds a glittering sword outstretched in 
one hand and carries a balance in the other. 
The statue is eight feet tall and stands on a 
four-foot-tall pedastal. 
</div>

They head south, to a four-way intersection. In the center of the intersection is a magnificent statue, but the elect not to touch it, as they promised the Earl. To their left is a door that radiates heat - no doubt the Earl's quarters. So they go right, to the west.
</p><div class="divbreak">&mdash;&nbsp;&dagger;&nbsp;&mdash;</div><p>
<div class="sidel"><div class="sideh">
7. The Silent Gallery </div>
This two-tiered hall shines with purple light 
from four large chandeliers. A large black 
sphere hangs between them. The chandeliers seem to be sculpted with small 
humanoid ﬁgures in silvery metal. A second-ﬂoor gallery with arches and spiral-striped pillars runs the length of the hallway to a second set of large double doors. 
The black tile ﬂoor absorbs the light from 
the chandeliers, and even sound in this 
chamber seems muted and dull. 
</div>
The party check the second-floor gallery, avoiding the area under the chandeliers and the large black sphere. The door to the west is a fake. 
<div class="sider"><div class="sideh">8. The Courtesan’s 
Tomb</div>
This small but well-appointed room has 
a delicately arched ceiling. The walls are 
painted with garden scenes featuring two 
Wind Duke lovers, and the center of the 
room contains a large urn with a dark red 
glaze and gold decorations. Six small boxes, 
each carved of some black substance bound 
with corroded metal, line the back wall. 
Chairs sit in each corner. 
</div>
Behind the door to the north is a small room. The party see the large urn and get totally paranoid, and elect to leave the room absolutely alone.
</p><div class="divbreak">&mdash;&nbsp;&dagger;&nbsp;&mdash;</div><p>
The south door leads to a passage sloping downward. Jericho elects to search the southern arm of the four-way intersection and the door at the south before continuing. While he does so, he is attacked! An enormous spider phases in out of nowhere and paralyses him. One of the party was watching, and raises an alarm, but as the party comes to assist, they step on and trigger a trap n the corridor, that they had by sheer luck avoided earlier. The trap is a word of law, and both Jericho and the spider are paralyzed. So the party simply dismember the spider, and Frith casts <i>Remove Paralysis</i> on Jericho. The sothern door is another fake, so the party return to the Silent Gallery and venture south down the sloping corridor.
</p><p class="smaller">
So much for flycatcher. There is a bit of a subplot involving him, but the party will never know.
</p><div class="divbreak">&mdash;&nbsp;&dagger;&nbsp;&mdash;</div><p>

<div class="sidel"><div class="sideh">9. The Shadow Web </div>
This rectangular room has small columns 
around the edges that partially hide the 
carvings along the walls. Pale white light 
glows from two large wheel-shaped chandeliers, casting overlapping shadows 
throughout the room. Blue metal double 
doors stand at the top of a ﬂight of stairs 
opposite the main entrance, guarded by 
two warrior ﬁgures with raised double 
swords, as well as a single doorway to the 
south and double doors to the north, also 
guarded by warrior statues. 
</div>
<div class="sidel"><div class="sideh">13. The Wind Duke’s 
Antechamber</div>
A small statue of an armored Wind Duke, 
his left hand resting on a sword, his right 
held up to shield his eyes, stands at the far 
wall of this room as part of a small shrine. 
The statue seems to be made of gold, with 
sparkling blue gems for eyes; a beam of 
bright light shines onto the statue from 
above. The walls are carved with bas-reliefs 
of Wind Duke servants bowing and soldiers saluting. An elaborate carpet covers
the ﬂoor, but it is badly worn and the colors have faded—only small patches of the 
complete pattern remain. 
 </div>
<img src="images/Week28-Map2.png" align="right">
The party recognise room at the end of the passage as the room that the Earl spoke of. Ignoring the doors to the north and south, they head up the stairs to the west. Here is a smaller room, featuring a gold statue. The party decide that here is a good enough spot to rest - if they don't interfere with the statur. But first, Jericho decides to check what's behind the door to the south.
</p><p>
<div class="sidel"><div class="sideh">14. The Tempest Globe </div>
This room is full of ﬂickering bluish light 
and a breeze that smells like thunderstorms. The ﬂoor slopes down toward the 
center from all directions, like a funnel. At 
the bottom crackles a sparkling globe of 
lightning. A metallic spike protruding down 
from a stone block in the ceiling touches 
the very tip of the globe’s upper curve. 
Inside the globe ﬂoats a human ﬁgure, a 
man with a long dark beard wearing torn 
and stained red robes. 
</div>
Bloody hell! They have found Allustan! He seems to be trapped in some sort of temporal stasis. The party decide to rest and regain spells - Allustan doesn't seem to be going anywhere - and to deal with whatever it is in the morning.
</p><p>
In the morning, Flash casts a <i>Dispell Magic</i> on the globe. The globe flickers out, and Allustan slumps to the floor - gravely injured and bleeding out. Gauthakan runs into the room and retrieves him before the globe can reappear, and Frith heals him.
</p><p class="smaller">
The party were damn lucky - their <i>Dispell Magic</i> suppressed the globe for the maximum time. Any less lucky, and the lightning generator would have restarted and Allustan would have been toast.
</p><p>
Allustan immediately asks about the dragon, and they party and he exchange stories. It seems he simply wandered into the tomb and avoided the traps by combination of sheer luck and not touching anything. He tells the party:
<blockquote>
“This place is important. 
A powerful general is entombed here, 
and a lot of powerful magic is entombed 
with him. The Wind Dukes had a habit 
of burying their weapons with their dead 
in the months after the their victory over 
Chaos. Not to honor the dead as much 
as to store these weapons in a safe place, 
so that should Chaos rise again, the 
weapons would be available to them. I 
believe that something powerful indeed 
is hidden somewhere in this tomb, and 
I believe it can help us in the dark times 
that face us today.”</blockquote>
</p><p>
As to the trap in the next room, Allustan suggests that they simply deal with the iron spike hanging off the bottom of the generator o the ceiling.
</p><p>
Gauthakan, lacking suitable missiles, elects to rip the door off its hinges. Oh no! And he party were <i>warned</i> not to damage the fittings! A pair of golems emerge from the reliefs around the room, and attack Gauthakan. They are immune to magic, but Allustan casts <i>Stoneskin</i> on Gauthakan, on whom the golems focus their attacks. The golems are eventually defeated, and Gauthakan flings chunks of the resulting debirs at the lightning generator until the iron spkike at the base is broken.
</p><p class="smaller">
Well! Will that party take Allustan's advice and loot the tomb for weapons? Oooh, I rather suspect they will. But what even worse dangers lie in store, deeper in the tomb?
