<h3>Week 40 - Sure, she’s evil, but do we really care?</h3>
<p class="smaller">
This week we say goodbye to Jericho and Hello to Mend, the warfaorged artificer.
The party got through the initial bits of this adventure quicker than I had thought they would, and consequently I was not prepared and had to end the session a bit early. Whatever.
</p>
<p>
Well, after the big party, everyone sleeps off the booze (and the poison). Their appointment with Lashonna is only a couple of days off, and they take it easy. Soon the day comes. What to do? They are aware that she is an evil vampiric silver dragon &hellip; but what does that mean? Only one way to find out: prepare all their best anti-undead buffs, and head to Mistwall Manor.
</p>
<p>
<div class="sidel">The walls of this spacious, tastefully decoratedstudy are fi lled with shelves of leatherboundtomes on a wide variety of topics. Alarge desk sits against the far wall, its surfaceempty save for a stack of tattered pieces ofyellowed paper. The carpet is a deep shadeof crimson, and arrayed on it in a semicircle
before the desk are several high-backedchairs fi tted with velvet cushions.</div>
A coach picks them up, driven by the manservant Kelgorn who, Frith notices, is charmed. But that’s hardly an unexpected development. They head to the lady’s manor and thence ensues a <em>long</em> cutscene.
</p>
<div class="img450"><img src="images/LLR-Journal.png"></div>
<div class="img300"><img src="images/LLR-Lashonna.png">
Lashonna waits here for the PCs,wrapped in a gold-trimmed gown of thevery latest fashion and cut to accentuateher near-perfect figure. As the PCsenter, a delighted smile dances uponher scarlet lips before she dismisses hermanservant. “You won’t be needed anylonger Kelgorn, I’m sure I’ll be quite wellattended to, with such pleasing gueststo keep me company. Good night.”
<br>
She indicates the tatteredpages on the table as shesays, “Balakarde’s journal, or what’s leftof it, in any event. You’ll see he’s quitemad. Obsessed, the poor dear, and withworms no less. Tiresome. But please,look it over, and then we can talk.”
</div>

<div class="cutscene"><p>
“It seems obvious that Dragotha intendsto release Kyuss from his prison, and inso doing, usher in the Age of Worms. Thesolution seems obvious. A king without hiscommander is powerless. It’s taken Dragothanearly 1,500 years to reach this point.
Remove him now, and it will certainlybe centuries before anything has achance to release the Wormgodagain.
</p><p>“Of course, one cannot simplywaltz into a lich’s lair, kill him,and be done with it. Dragothamay not know where his phylacteryis, but that doesn’t mean it’suseless to him. Destroying himbefore you destroy his phylacteryis as good as finding it andhanding it over to him.
</p><p>“So your first order of businessshould be to find his phylacteryand destroy it. And that’swhere it gets complicated. Ihave no idea where it may behidden. Obviously, neitherdoes Dragotha, and that’sa good thing. Certainly, hisdoubt to its location is themain reason he hasn’t triedto simply destroy himself asa desperate way to discoverits location.</p><p>“Balakarde left for the Wormcrawl Fissure - also known as the GoradraGap of the Mror Holds - against my advice, intending to learnmore about Dragotha. He never returned,but at least he had the foresight to leave hisjournal fragments with me. His journal andhis disappearance have become somethingof a minor obsession of mine, I must confess.I’ve spent the last sixteen years, on andoff , studying the lore of Kyuss, of Dragotha,and associated matters. And while I haven’tmanaged to determine where Dragotha’sphylactery is hidden, I do believe I knowwhere that information might be found.</p><p>“As Balakarde mentions in his journal,the Age of Worms and Kyuss’ resurrectionwere stopped fifteen centuries ago bythe Order of the Storm. Historians believethat the Order died out not long aft er thisvictory, hunted down and destroyed bythe last surviving members of the cult ofKyuss. These records are incorrect. TheOrder instead retreated to their strongholdon a hidden island off the coast of the Lhazaar Principalities.</p><p>“On this island there is a library of sorts,a repository of the Order’s lore. It has beensought for centuries by wizards, scholars,and explorers, for it is said to be filled withhundreds of years of history, memories,
dreams, and of course secrets. Secrets areso valuable aren’t they, my darlings? Seemsthe longer they are kept, the more they’reworth. If a written account of the secretof what happened to Dragotha’s phylacteryexists, it must certainly be there.</p><p>
“Of course, there are complications—there always are, right? Before they builtthis library, the Order of the Storm drovea lasting bargain with primal elementalforces. They sacrifi ced their lives to whiskthe island’s interior off the Material Plane.In its place is a barren rock surrounded byan ever-raging storm of such intensity thatships that approach within ten miles areinvariably lost. The island itself appears onno maps, but the stories hint that the druidsleft a way for those in need to reachtheir secrets while at the same time wardingthe place away from the prying eyes ofKyuss’ undead fanatics.</p><p>
“Worse, I’m afraid others have learnedthis as well, in part as an unfortunate resultof my own research. I have a fair amount ofcompetition in the arena of gathering andkeeping secrets, and invariably word getsout that I’ve made a discovery. My enemiesare always quick to nip at my heals. I speak,in particular, of a simpering dog of a mannamed Heskin who once served me. I’mafraid Heskin has been wooed from my
side with promises of wealth and power,and has taken word of this discovery to adisreputable man indeed, a powerful priestof Vecna named Darl Quethos.”</p>
</div>

<p>
Lasonna produces a lock of hair from Heskin, commenting about how it’s good to be on good terms with barbers. Oops, think the characters, as they recall having their own hair cut and primped for the party. Anyway, Lashonna suggests they spy on Heskin, and the party agree, introducing yet another long cutscene:
</p>

<div class="cutscene"><p>
A tumultuous scene fades into view in themiddle of the room for all to observe, alongwith the howling sound of an oceanic tempest.The image clears to show a deathlypale man lashed to a ship’s mast with severalcoils of rope. Although details beyonda ten-foot-radius around Heskin are hazyand unclear, it’s obvious that the ship iscaught in a tremendous storm—the decksare awash in foamy water as both wavesand driving sheets of rain torment the terrified man. Sounds of gruff sailors shoutingcommands and curses in Orc can beheard under the raging tumult of the storm,and now and then, frantic orc sailors movequickly into view and then back into obscurityas they busy themselves at securing theship. At one point, two lithe, cloaked figuresdrop to the deck from the rigging on eitherside of Heskin. They are identically dressedin tightly wrapped silken scarves, smalldevilish horns sprouting from their heads.The cloaked figures spare condescendingglances at Heskin, their eyes glowing faintlywith infernal fire before they move out ofsight toward the ship’s unseen bow. Soonthereafter, a blazing red-skinned humanoidwith an immense, bulging frame stridesalmost casually through the scene. The rainsizzles into steam as it strikes his burningskin. As he reaches Heskin, he looks downat the man and then looks toward the bow,crying out, “Darl! It looks like your pet mightbe taking on water!” With that, the creatureexplodes into a tremendous belly laugh. Afew moments later, another two figures stepinto view. </p>
<div class="img300"><img src="images/LLR-DarlQuerthos.png"></div><p>
The smaller of the two is a shifty eyedhumanoid bird who wears a hoodedcloak and carries a repeating crossbow. Theother is a towering man clothed in flowingblue robes trimmed with eye designs.His cowl protects his face from the windand his hands are obscured by long, rainsoakedsleeves. He squats before Heskinand speaks to him in a low voice, “Only afew hours more, Heskin, and we shall see ifyou live or die.”
</p><p>Suddenly, the blue-robed man’s headwhips around to look directly into the scryingsensor. His face is pale but commanding,and twists into a snarl as he stands.“It seems we have guests, my friends,” hesays. “Perhaps allies of this cur?” He turnsback to the bound man, and as he does hepulls back his left sleeve, revealing a rotten,black-nailed appendage that seemsto writhe and twitch with its own life. “Wecan’t have your friends watching us, soit seems your journey comes to an earlyend, Hesken!” The putrid hand unfurls andreaches out to caress Heskin’s brow. Heskinshrieks in mortal pain as the fingertipfreezes the skin it touches into an angryblack scar. The blue-robed man then makesa fist and utters a single unintelligible word.As he utters the word, Hesken’s eyes bulge,the cords in his neck throb, and he slumpsagainst his bonds, dead. The scrying link isbroken, and the image fades from view.</p>
</div>

<p>
The party, and Lashonna, are shaken - recognising the Hand of Vecna, a remnant of a mightyQabalrin necromancer, thought to have beenthe first humanoid lich on Eberron. The scrying broken, they return to their seats, have a fortifying sip of wine, and the party prepare to question Lashonna a little more closely.
</p><p>
Lashonna explains (again) that the phylactery must be destroyed first. If Dragotha is killed first, he will simply reconstitute a body at his phylactery. He has not already done this, of course, because the gatekeepers would certainly have put the phylactery in some sort of elaborate trap. Lashonna also briefly discusses how Dragotha is a red dragon - the  same one they saw in their vision at the Spire of Long Shadows, and so is without question unspeakbly evil and powerful, even without being a lich. The party dance around the other big question for a moment or two, then Flash just comes out and says it: “You’re an evil undead dragon. Why should we trust you?”
</p><p>
“Well,” says Lashnna, “this should be refreshing.” </p>
<p class="smaller">I invented some of this text myself. I’m so proud.</p>
<div class="cutscene">
“You call me evil - perhaps I would have too, before my change. Where once I sought to serve, I now seek to rule. And I <em>do</em> rule. And why should I not? Should this city’s fortunes be left in the hands of that half-mad human living in the castle? Or the succession of madmen and brutes before him?”
</div>
<p>With respect to all the political repression, she says:</p>
<div class="cutscene">
“This city is the safest and best-run city for hundreds of miles around. All I insist on in return is that the people not engage in sedition. What’s unusual about that? There are always malcontents, and I act as any sensible ruler does. Yes, occasionally I have to step on a few necks (never literally, of course), but consider the alternative: blood in the streets, chaos, and a return to more rulers like Prince Zeech - because no matter how well they start, that’s what power invariably does to humans.”
</div>
<p>With respect to the Age of Worms, she says:</p>
<div class="cutscene">
“I’ve spent years gettingwhere I am, and I’m not about to see allthat washed away by Dragotha, and neithershould you. Take care of Dragotha,and if you still feel that I can’t be trusted,you know where to find me.”
</div>
<p>As to the Ziggurat, she says:</p>
<div class="cutscene">
“Prince Zeech began building that thing about ten years ago. Yes, I know what it is. I don’t know who is influencing him - the entire idea of this whole arrangement is that no-one ought be influencing him but me. As far as I am aware, dreams come to him: perhaps Kyuss himself, perhaps agents of the Ebon Triad hidden in the castle. I have worked to delay its completion, but now it is only a matter of months. If necessary, yes, I will reveal myself and tear it down. But the job is not so easy as it appears - the Ziggurat is made from more than stone, its roots are divine magic and go deep into the earth.”
</div>
<p>With respect to, well, the vampirism, she shows a little of her true colours:</p>
<div class="cutscene">
“And so? Do you fear for yourselves? Do you fear for the little people of this city? When the blood thirst comes upon me, do you really suppose that it is human blood I crave? I tell you, though I see things a little differently now to before my change, I have not forgotten how much I hate the spawn of Tiamat.<p> 
“I let that cow <strong>live</strong> in <em>my</em> city! I let her grow <strong>fat</strong> in my city. I even let her raise a little <strong>family</strong> in my city &hellip; although originally there were a dozen eggs - one must be sensible about these things. And for what? For you to kill? Damn you all - <strong>what am I going to do for my next meal now?”</strong>
</div>
<p>But, she composes herself. Finally the party ask - where is this Tilagos Island, and how the heck to we get there?</p>
<div class="cutscene">
“TilagosIsland is located east of here. It doesn’t appear on mostmaps, but I happen to have some thatgive its location. At least, its approximatelocation.”<br>“But as to your transport: if you need help with that, maybe youshouldn’t be tangling with what awaitsyou there. Take a boat? Fly a dragon?Teleport? I’m sure you’ve got plenty ofoptions available.”
</div>

<p>And that essentially concludes the interview with Lashonna. A map, some journal fragments, and perhaps a better understanding of the political realities of the fair town of Alhaster.</p>

<div class="divbreak">&mdash;&nbsp;&dagger;&nbsp;&mdash;</div>

<p>
Well, the party figure that although Heskin may be dead, his body lies within the storms surrounding Tilagos Island. So a <i>Discern&nbsp;Location</i> on his body should do the trick. They <i>Shadow&nbsp;Walk</i>, popping put of the plane to get their bearings at intervals (with the aid of <i>Water&nbsp;Walking</i>). Eventually, they come to the Island. The storms have been there for so long that their reality bleeds through to the plane of shadow, and the lone sheltered beach is easy to locate. They pop out of the shadows onto Tilagos Island beach, ready for anything.
</p><div class="divbreak">&mdash;&nbsp;&dagger;&nbsp;&mdash;</div>
<p>
<div class="sidel"><div class="sideh">M1. Shipwreck Beach</div>
The beachhead is littered with driftwoodand the splintered ruin of wellover a hundred ships. These skeletalwrecks crowd the rocky shoreline, averitable city of barnacle-claimed vesselspeopled with dead sailors. Brokenskeletons wrapped in threadbare ragshang out of yawning breaches in theships’ hulls, and tattered sails whip inthe fierce winds sweeping the shoreline.One ship stands out from theseweathered hulks—a recent victim of thewind and rocks, although a victim nonetheless.This gigantic sailing cog liesbroken in two against a jagged rock onthe eastern edge of the beach. Beyondthe shore, the rocky beach angles upslightly to an ancient maze of ruinedwalls and standing stones.</div>
There are a lot of Orcish sailors on the beach, but they do not attack immediately. Flash addresses them in orc, and persudes them to hear him out. It transpires that Darl Querthos has moved inland, beyond the maze. The orcs do not belive that he will come and get them or anything. Realists to a man. They are salvaging lumber and rope and building the best raft they can manage, intending to hoist sail once they have rowed beyond the storms. A shitty plan, but the only one possible.
</p><p>
Mend offers to help them: when they have collected the materials and fashioned a rough raft, he will use his powers of artifice to make it seaworthy. The orcs &hellip; are hopeful, but don’t really believe it. It’s clear that the party intend to chase Darl, and the orcs don’t think much of their chances should they catch him. They return to what they were doing.
</p><p>
The party sees a maze in fromt of them, and decides to use <i>Find&nbsp;the&nbsp;Path</i> to “the other side of this maze”.  The spell works as advertised, and Frith or Flash immediately knows that “this” is the right direction to go. So they go thataway.
</p><p>
<div class="sidel"><div class="sideh">M3. The Forest of StonyTeeth </div>
The ruins here are complicated with a newfeature; numerous spindly stone stalagmitesfi ll the area. The rocky growths arecarved with strange slash-like glyphs alongvertical lines, but seem to have no otherpurpose. A small tangle of green glowingcrystals grows from the base of a stalagmitenear the center of this area.
</div>
On the way, they encounter a nest of Ropers. But their standard buffs include a <i>Freedom&nbsp;of&nbsp;Movement</i> all around, so the roper’s main trick is pointless. Gauthakan issues  some smackdown, mainly for amusement. Bbelow the big roper in the middle are some green crystals, which they pocket.
</p><p>
<div class="sidel"><div class="sideh">M6. Portal of Storms</div>A circular disc hewn from obsidian lieshere, its rim decorated with strange runes.At three points around the disc’s circumference,stylized eyes have been carved, eachwith a shallow hollow carved within to representthe pupil.</div>

The get through the maze and their spell ends, and before them is a portal. There are words written around it in Druidic, which Gauthakan reads with his <i>Helm&nbsp;of&nbsp;Comprehend&nbsp;Languages</i>: “Return my eyes tome, and I shall gaze through the storm.”
</p><p>
They put a green crystal in one of the eyes, and it lights up and goes ping. But it doesn’t work on the other eyes. Mend determines that each eye needs a different crystal. The party decides “screw that” to the notion of hunting for crystals to fit, and instead Mend takes out his toolkit and soon has the portal activated. The party step through.
</p><div class="cutscene"><p>
The sudden shift in environment is shockingand overwhelming for a moment.The sound of the raging tempest is gone,replaced by a gentle wind carrying birdsongsand the drone of buzzing insects.The sky above is overcast, yet it doesn’tseem ready to storm.
</p><p>The edge of a sprawling black forest,dense and overgrown, fills the view in onedirection. Tall trees sag with branches heavywith moss, their dark eaves dropping tothe ground in some places. From withincomes a cacophony of insects and singingbirds. Now and then, a ghostly green glowappears within, only to fade moments later,as if whatever creature was generating thelight was afraid to be seen.
</p><p>
In the other directions grassy hills rise.Opposite the forest, these hills eventuallybecome a range of rocky, barrenmountains. A flash of brilliant lightningignites the sky above the mountains fora moment, and the distant peal of mutedthunder echoes down the slopes a fewmoments after.
</p>
</div>

<p class="smaller">
And that’s it. That’s as much of the module as I had printed out, so bleh. Where is this library, anyway? A hidden cave? In the sea? The sky? And what fearsome guardians guard it? Never fear! I’m confident that these guys will find out, and not get killed by the thingy. Till next week!
