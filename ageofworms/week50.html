<a name="text"><h3>Week 50 - A scholar calls for help.</h3></a>
<p>
Holy crap! Our brave adventurers have destroyed a dracolich’s <strike>horcrux</strike> phylactery, and not just any dracolich (not that there is any such thing as “just any” dracolich) but the lich who is the herald of Kyuss - Dragotha himself!
</p><p>
Dragotha will construct another phylactery, and if he does then all the efforts of the Order of the Storm will have been in vain. But such a project takes months - it is not a simple thing. So the party go shopping, and Mend uses his demiplane with its speeded-up-time to make some items. Then its off once more to the Goradra Gap, this time to one of its deepest and most dangerous zones - a blind canyon known as the Wormcrawl Fissure. According to legend it was here, in ages past, that Khyber attempted to rise up and escape the bonds of Eberron. A fitting place for the minions of Kyuss and the overlord Katashka.
</p><p>
<div class="sidel"><div class="sideh">The Wormcrawl Fissure</div>
<p>
A particularly deep spur canyonextending from the westernmost reachesof the Rift Canyon, the WormcrawlFissure is well known as one of the mostmysterious and dangerous regions in theworld. Few have braved its depths, but itsperimeter is thouroughly documented.
</p><p>The Wormcrawl can be divided intotwo distinct zones: the Heights and theDepths. The Heights extend about 300feet down into the Fissure. The cavernsthat riddle the walls of this region areinfested with tough groups of ruffiansand goblinoids, along with numerousvermin and flying monsters. The worstof this bunch are the derro of theRazorwind tribe, a group of bandits whoride highly-trained wyverns.
</p><p style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">
(Of course, no-one ever thinks to ask whom they practice their banditry upon, so far from any potential victims.)</p><p>The Wormcrawl Depths are oftenshrouded in a thick mist that blocksthe cleansing light of the sun, creatinga perfect place for the undead spawn ofKyuss to fester and grow. The deepestpoint is said to be a mile below sea level,and the caverns that branch off fromthe cliffs doubtless go even deeper.Numerous undead menaces dwell here,including many types of spawn of Kyuss,nightcrawlers, and worse.
</div>
<div class="visionr">
The contactis rushed and fearful - a sudden rush of images. The first is ofa mist-shrouded gorge, the floor a mazeof rifts and pits in which immense verminsquirm. The second is of a toweringworm, its head a tangle of eyes and itspale body shrouded in a haze of writhingfilaments. This immense worm lungesforth to consume the viewer, and fadesto be replaced by a third, that of a stately lookingman dressed in an explorer’s outfit.He sports a distinctive high beard andmoustache, and suddenly his expressionbecomes one of abject horror as his fleshrots away and a storm of green wormsconsumes him from within.
</div>
The party head to the canyon, which is shrouded at all times in gloomy mist. Venturing in, Mend is assailed by a <strike>plot hook</strike> vision. A spirit - a scholar like himself - makes contact via a terrible vision. Though horrifying, he is not overwhelmed by it, and after the vision is done he feels a tugging - a desire to investigate “thataway”. Through their telepathic bond, Frith recognises the gentleman as Balakarde - who, it seems, has always been one step ahead of them. The party decide that this is as good a starting point as any, and head thataway. 
</p><div>&mdash;&nbsp;&dagger;&nbsp;&mdash;</div><p>
<div class="img300">
<b>Earthcancer Centipede</b><hr>
A thirty-five-foot-long pale green and whitecentipede scuttles sinuously over the barrenearth. Its dark green eyes peer above a nestof several long antennae writhing on its face.Tiny green worms drip from its mouth andcracks in its chitinous armor, and at placeswhere it stands or touches the rock walls, theearth turns gray and boils into nasty, tumorlikegrowths of pale fungus.</div>
They shadow-walk in the direction of Mend’s tugging, but the terrain soon becomes close enough that shadow-walking is not accurate enough. They pop out of the shadow plane next to a cave entrance. Gauthakan flies in in bat form, turning right he sees a nest of enormous, hideous centipedes - most of them already burrowing through the wall, heading straight for the party. He transforms out of bat form and prepares to battle. meanwhile, outside, the party see the first cetipedes emerge from the wall, and the fight is on.
</p><p>
<div class="img300"><b>Mindkiller Scorpion</b><hr>This hideous scorpion is a nasty, black,twenty-foot-long menace. Its chitinous armoris a tangle of cruel hooked spikes and cracksthat leaks ichor. It has three scorpion tailsinstead of one, and the tips of each tail sportseveral long, green crystalline stingers andplates, looking like some sort of dangerousfanged flower.</div>
The fight progresses for a few seconds or so - although hideous, the centipedes are not difficult to deal with. But then a pair of scorpions emerge from the depths - each radiating an aura of madness. One heads for the chamber in which Gauthakan is fighting, the other heads outside. Gauthkan is protected by a <i>Circlet of Mind Blanking</i>, crafted by Mend at enormous expense. The rest of the party os not so lucky - Screechy is driven part way to madness by the thing. The party outside concentrate their fire and manage to bring down the scorpion without too much trouble. Gauthakan inside hammers away, and the monsters are dealt with. 
</p><p>
Mend and Gauthakan head into the interior hamber, looking for loot, while the other members of the party heal up. But less than a minute later, the true master of these caves emerges: the ancient ulgurstasta N’vesh-n’kar, first Apostle of Kyuss. This gigantic wormlike abberation comes flying through the air. It ignores Mend, who is immune to the spell it intends to use, and does not see Gauthakan, who is protetced by his <i>Wraithhunter</i> shirt. Instead it lobbs a <i>Horrid Wilting</i> at the party outside, and it’s on again.
</p><p>
Gauthakan <i>Spider Climbs</i> the walls and lands on the apostle’s back. Meanwhile, the other party members begin lobbing <i>Dispell Magic</i> spells at it. Eventually, someone manages to dispel the <i>Fly</i> spell. Falling into the pit of sharp shards of bone, the monster is wounded, and it <i>Dimension Doors</i> out. 
</p><p>
And so the party move into exploration mode. Gauthakan heads left, and is hit by a trap - a fiendish device that fires <i>Greater Dispel Magic</i> and <i>Finger of Death</i> spells. Retreating quickly, Mend is sent in. Both of his <i>Rings of Couterspelling</i>, equipped to counterspel <i>Dispel Magic</i> are discharged, but he has a <i>Death Ward</i> effect in place and so is immune to the FoD anyway. He swiftly disarms the device before it can eliminate any of his magical protections.
</p><p>
Heading further in, they find the Apostle’s lair, and it appears fully healed. The corridor is choked with dragon and chimera skeletons, which Frith begins turning. Gauthakan also notices that the chamber they approach is full of loot. But oddly - the Apostle falls lifeless. Unconcious. As the party battle the skeletons, they are bombarded by some sort of psychic attack. And them, as they clear away the last of the skeletons, Frith senses thought their <i>Telepathic Bond</i> that Screech has suddenly gone missing. Meanwhile, Screechy before them turns and starts attacking the party with spells. 
</p><p>
Gauthakan grapples him - Screechy suddenly being curiously unskilled in the barbarianly arts, and the party begin looking for the <i>Magic Jar</i>  holding his soul. Sensing that all is nearly lost, N’vesh-n’kar gives up on the <i>Magic Jar</i> spell and returns to his body, prepared to batle to the last.
</p><p>
So they kill him.
</p><div class="divbreak">&mdash;&nbsp;&dagger;&nbsp;&mdash;</div><p>
Well! There is a <em>lot</em> of loot, and several powerful and horribly evil magic items, which Mend will no doubt drain. And something &hellip; interesting.
</p><p>
An <i>Everfull Purse</i> is here, and attached to it is a fragment of someone’s soul - Balakarde’s no doubt. Retrieving the item, a couple of things happen. First, the presence of the scholar in the item offers help and advice to whoever hold it. Second, the bearer of the item becomes aware of the location of two other fragments of soul.
</p><p>
There’s one <em>thataway</em>, and one <em>thataway</em>.
</p><div class="divbreak">&mdash;&nbsp;&dagger;&nbsp;&mdash;</div><p class="smaller">
Well! Will the party opt to retrieve the other two soul fragments, or will they just charge straight of to beard Dragotha? And will they go thataway, or thataway? Let’s find out!
