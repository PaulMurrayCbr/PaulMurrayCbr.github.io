<p class="smaller">
This will be a little brief
</p><p>
Following the urging of the two parts of Balakarde’s spirit, the party head southwest. On the way, they meet and deal with a terrifying worm/dragon hybrid, which nearly offs Flash. They eventually arrive at a tower.
</p><p>
They assault the tower by means of Mend cracking the lock on the front door. Heading in, they encounter an art gallery. As they gear up to fight, a Lillend descends the stairs. As these are good creatures of legend, they opt to talk - Flash at his charming best to apologise for their break-in.
</p><p>
Zulshyn does indeed have the item they seek, haunted by the third part of Balakarde’s spirit, but is loath to part with it. For this third aspect of Balakarde is a superlative artist, and he and Zulshyn are collaborating on a number of works. The party drop a bunch of expensive loot on her, and they have destroyed the lich Thessalar (whose plans for her were not terribly nice), ad so she agrees and hands over a small statue.
</p><p class="smaller">
Dull, dull, dull. Zulshyn would have accepted an artwork, but mend does not have craft painting/sculpting, and flash does not have perform. She also would have been vey glad to accept Mend’s service for a year, but Mend is committed to dealing with the Age of Worms. Out of game info: if he survives, serving for a year would not be a worry as the eve of the age of worms is Real Soon Now. But there you go. The party went with the boring option. 
</p><p>

As the three items are bought together - the everful purse, the spellshard, and the figurine - there’s some light and sound effects and the ghost of Balakarde stands before them. He speaks with them a while and covers some plot points that the party has not dealt with yet - including what happens if the worms get you. He advises the party on how to deal with Dragotha: clean out the minions first, is his advice.
</p><p>
<div class="img450"><img src="images/WCF-Citadel.png">
<p>The passageway opens onto a relativelynarrow ledge that overlooks an immensecircular cavern lit by a nauseating greenglow. The cavern seems to be roughlyovoid in shape. The walls, ceiling, andfloor shimmer here and there with
phosphorescent fungi, but the predominantsource of lighting is the sloshing lake ofthick green slime at the far end of thecave. Several turgid waterfalls of the stuffdrool from openings high up on the farwall of the cave, and now and then thickshapes of the things that dwell withinthe slime lake ripple against its surface.The lake’s beaches are an horrific mix ofdried crusty slime and millions of writhingworms that feast on the stuff, the soundof their rasping mouths working inunison, filling the cavern with a strangelysoothing hiss.</p><p>On the closest shore of the nightmarelake, yet still nearly a half-mile fromthe ledge, looms an immense pile ofstalagmites and upthrust pillars of greenrock that form a natural castle. A hugecentral pillar of stone rises up from thefortress to merge with the roof above. Sixsmaller stalagmite-like towers rise aroundthe structure’s perimeter. Coiled aroundeach of these spires are immense greenworms, their fanged heads twitchinglazily to and fro like sentinels, observingthe cavern around them. A moat of greensludge surrounds the structure, and asingle crooked bridge arches up over it toa pair of massive stone doors.

The party then heads to the deepest, scaryest part of the rift. Woooo! There’s a bit of a cave entrance with some guardians. Which they kill. Then a big tunnell, and finally at the end a castl-ey thing.
