<a name="text"><h3>Week 53 - The Tabernacle of Worms.</h3></a>
<div class="img450"><img src="images/Colossal.png"></div>
<p class="smaller">
Oh my Lord, nearly done. It’s been a long year-and-a-half. My players have given me a wonderful christmas present - an “Icons” colossal red dragon. I am displaying it without the detachable fiery breath as I think it looks just a little too much like vomit. Instead, I have a Giants of Legend Standard-bearer (3/72, UC) to give a sense of scale. 
</p>
<p class="smaller">
See the guy with the banner? That’s you. See the big red thing? That’s the dragon. See the crook-looking brick buildings? Those are the nasty ex-govvie flats where I live, but ignore those for now. 
</p>
<p class="smaller">
Point is, it’s colossal. It’s going to be a Dracolich. And it is going to kill the party next session. For sure. But, as is becoming usual, I have left off writing up the story for this last session until late.
</p>
<div class="divbreak">&mdash;&nbsp;&dagger;&nbsp;&mdash;</div>
<div class="img450"><img src="images/WCF-Citadel.png">
A half-mile from the ledge looms an immense pile of stalagmites and upthrust pillars of green rock that form a natural castle. A huge central pillar of stone rises up from the fortress to merge with the roof above. Six smaller stalagmite-like towers rise around the structure’s perimeter. Coiled around each of these spires are immense green worms, their fanged heads twitching lazily to and fro like sentinels, observing the cavern around them. The stone bridge ends at a distant door, which looks suspiciously like a vagina.</div>
<p>
Our budding young demigods head out over the bridge connecting the shore to the massive structure in the middle of the lake of slime. The elect to <i>Fly</i>, and to go under cover of an <i>Invisibility Sphere</i>. But they chose to fly directly over the bridge itself.
</p><p>
<div class="img450"><img src="images/WCF-VenkAndZyrith.png"></div>
Well, it does not work out as well as they had hoped. The sentinels - for sentinels they are - see them and set up a racket. After a moment or two, a wyvern and rider emerge from the castle-thingy. The party land on the bridge &hellip; or, some of them land and some weren’t flying in the first place. Whatever. After one attack, the dragon is toast thanks to a <i>Destruction</i> from Frith, and the rider cops it from Flash, via a <i>Final Rebuke</i>.  
</p><p>
<div class="img450"><img src="images/Week53-Map1.png"></div>
<div class="sidel"><div class="sideh">1. Tabenacle Entrance</div>Two massive stone doors set into the sideof the fortress block further progress. Eachdoor seems to be made of dark stone, yeteach ripples like shivering flesh as countlessgreen worms burrow through it.
</div>
So to the door. Well, the door is a living mass of Kyuss worms. Yow! Frith has his <i>Repel Vermin</i> spell on, but the worms in the door are held in place by a magical effect, and cannot flee. After a bit of discussion, Flash attempts a <i>Knock</i> spell. Which, unbelievably, works! The door collapses into a disorganised mass of worms, which creep away from Frith as fast as their repellent peristalsis can take them.  
</p><p>
<div class="sidel"><div class="sideh">
2. Temple of the Worm</div>This immense hall has a vaulted ceiling thatrises to a height of nearly eighty feet. Thefloor is of highly polished stone. To the east,a flight of stairs leads up to a passageway,while a single writhing door of worms sitsin the west wall. Numerous alcoves line thewalls, each of which glows with golden lightand contains some sort of free-standingportal. A bank of stone pillars supports thevaulted ceiling in the east portion of thechamber, while to the west, the room isopen. Here, a fifteen-foot-wide fountain ofgreen liquid churns and sloshes. Standingon a pedestal in the center of the fountainis a ten-foot-tall humanoid statue dressedin tattered robes. The figure’s hands andpart of its face are visible—and appear tobe made of hundreds of worms.</div>

<div class="img300"><img src="images/WCF-Avolakia.png">Avolakia. Gross!</div>
But the inhabitants behind the door, thanks to the alarm already raised, are buffed up and ready for a fight. Six or so Avolakia priests of Kyuss (there are more of them, but only these are at home at present).
</p><p>
Battle ensues, spells are cast, Harmony - Gauthakan’s comic relief - demonstrates once again that D&amp;D monks are pretty much useless. There are walls of fire and of blades. Eventually, the party is victorious.
</p><p>
Mend, I think, checks out one of the spires (area 3, labelled “c” in the map). There’s a levitation field inside, and at the top a pair of binocular thingies. Fitting his eyes to them, he engages in a battle of wills with the worm that it is connected to. Victorious, he discovers that he can see through the worms eyes. He descends and informs the party of his discovery, and suggests that they don’t try it again.
</p><p>
<div class="sidel"><div class="sideh">
4. Grace of the Green</div>The walls, floors, and ceiling of this twentyfoot-high hall shimmer and waver withgreen light.</div>
They head up the big stairs to the left. One of the party sees through the illusion - I forget how - and reveals this halway for the fiendish deathtrap it is - it is <em>crawling</em> with Kyuss worms! Frith moves through it carefully with his <i>Repel Vermin</i> in effect, giving time for the worms to move away from him. Flash <i>Knocks</i> the doors open, revealing another pair of spire rooms.  Finally, he <i>Knocks</i> the doors at the end. There is some concern, as his spell does not always work, and he must try again. He is running out of magical power for the day.
</p><p>
<div class="sidel"><div class="sideh">
5. Birthing Chamber
</div>The stony walls of this vaulted chamberripple with the burrowing passage of thousandsof hissing green worms. Above, theceiling is a dome of green light that illuminatesthe chamber with a nauseating viridianshade. To the west, the wall curves andfeatures five tall windows that look out intoa large cavern. The floor near these windowsrises up to form a lip or rim around afive-foot-wide hole in the floor from whichdelicate tendrils of green mist rise. A cagemade of writhing green metal hangs froma stalk of green affixed to the ceiling above,its empty confines twisting lazily in the airabove the misting hole.</div>
<div class="sidel"><div class="sideh">
14. Wormdrake Lair
</div>The ceiling of this immense cavern risesup to a point nearly seventy feet above theledge that overlooks it from the southernentrance. This ledge winds upward alongthe northern wall, around a corner to theeast. The cave floor itself drops away inthree shelves, each ten feet lower than thelast. To the east, a stone pillar rises up fromthe floor and into the underside of a circularroom that protrudes balcony-like intothe cave from a chamber to the east. Strewnaround the base of the pillar is a fantasticswath of coins and other objects. The caveitself is filled with a shimmering greenglow from a huge circular pit to the south.</div>

Well, I forget the exact sequence. Everyone is avoiding the walls, as they are covered with worms.  Flash spends another spell slot or two opening the door to the south, behind which is revealed &hellip; another door. They decide not to interfere with the cage of strange metal, and instead look out over the ledge to the cavern beyond, using a <i>Daylight</i> spell to illuminate it.
</p><p>
Which wakes up the wormdrake. It breathes acid and cold at the party, who are protected somewhat by being behind cover. Then it recalls that it is able to <i>Greater Teleport</i>, and teleports into the birthing chamber. Well! That changes things. It breaths a nauseating stream of live Kyuss worms at Frith, who manages to save, dammit. Then before it can do much more damage, the party kill it.  
</p><p>
They investigate the chamber below. There is loot - oh yes, indeedy, there is loot. Quite a bit of it. There is also a strange glow coming from the south.
</p><p>
<div class="sidel"><div class="sideh">
15. Lower Wormvent</div>
A twenty-foot-wide shaft extends upthrough the ceiling and down into thedepths of the earth. Dozens, if not hundreds,of alcoves line the walls of this shaft.Some of these are empty, but just as manycontain the desiccated remains of a strangetentacled wormlike creature. The shaft itselffades into darkness above and below, anda thick rain of green fluid cascades downthe center of the shaft, filling the air withan oily haze and coating the walls withmoisture.</div>
The party take stock. Remembering Balakarde’s advice, they conclude that the heart of the temple is above, and there the dracolich, Dragotha. And in another dimension it’s late and time to break for Christmas ’08. Their options are to press on, to rest here, or to teleport out. Pressing on is problematic, as they are beginning to run low on spells. Resting here is out of the question: they will be attacked, and there are worms all over the place. So they decide to teleport out. 
</p><p>
But just as they prepare to do so, Flash’s <i>Moment of Prescience</i> kicks in. Don’t do it! Teleporting into or out of here is a <em>bad</em> idea.
</p>
<div class="divbreak">&mdash;&nbsp;&dagger;&nbsp;&mdash;</div>
<p class="smaller">
So, &hellip; what to do? Press on? Risk the consequences of teleporting home to rest? Give up and go home? Beats me! I’m just the DM. Hope everyone had a nice christmas and pleasant new year. See you all again hopefully this Friday.
