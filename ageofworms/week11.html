<h3>Week 11 - Under Siege.</h3>

Allustan and his small but effective guard head off for Blackwall Keep
to confer with Marzena, who is stationed there as battlemage. The party
are packed and ready to go, having done some shopping.
</p>
<p class="smaller">
I suppose the it all took a little longer than the three days that it
was going to have taken last week. Whatever. Can I just say at this
point that the items in the Magic Item Compendium are horribly
underpriced?
</p>
<p>

Before departure, there was a pair of little incidents involving Frith.
One of his druid nature-boy friends approached him and gave him a flask
containing four draughts of a potion for the curing of disease. He could
not give any  specific reason for it, save that he felt strongly to do
so. Odd. Odder still was the near identical incident later, involving
the priest of the Silver Flame. This priest gave Frith a loan of a holy
symbol of the  flame, which when employed will dismiss curses. Such
items, however, can only hold just so much of the Flame's virtue when
created. This one is old and worn, and probably only has 6 or so uses
left. Again, the only  reason for it is that "the Flame lit his way" to
offer it.

</p>
<p class="smaller">
The symbol is, of course, a wand of Remove Curse with 6 charges
remaining. Perhaps I ought to rule that, since Frith is not a priest of
the Silver Flame, it needs a UMD check. I like it - Frith can cast
Remove Curse  in his own right now that he's level 5, so it would be ok
for Flash or Jericho to use the wand.
</p>
<p>

Blackwall keep is one of a series of small forts along the Sharn/Wroat
road. Of course, everyone who is anyone uses the lightning rail. The
road mainly carries freight, people too poor or cheap to use the rail,
and  people such as our party, who have business along the road itself.
Bandits are uncommon here in the heart of Breland. However, the road
does run alongside the King's Forest - a huge and relatively untouched
forest.
</p>
<p>

Within the Kings Forest is the Mistmarsh, so named for the mist that
rises from it morning and evening. Blackwall keep has the distinction of
being the keep nearest the Mistmarsh, hence the battlemage. Unlike most
of  the forest, the Mistmarsh is rarely explored or entered. This is not
because of any specific  danger - it is simply that the terrain is
difficult and hazardous. There are reports of lizardfolk in the marsh,
but they  appear to be peaceful - content to be left alone. The attitude
of the Brelish forces seems to be that if the place is inhabited by the
lizardmen, then there's probably nothing seriously amiss with it.
</p>
<p>

During the day, the party meet some halfling wagoners - but nothing to
write home about. They mistime their schedule, however, and wind up
having to make camp that night by the road rather than in one of the
forts.  All is quiet. It is during Jericho's watch that the spiders
attack. The party scramble to emerge from their sleeping bags. Allustan
is bitten once - twice. He casts a spell of Dimension Door to get out of
the way of  the boys. Flash is also bitten, but Arn and Tom kick off
their sleeping bags and retrieve their weapons and soon have matters in
hand.
</p>
<p>

Frith uses the spell of Lesser Restoration to restore Flash, and next
day uses it a couple of times on Allustan. But ... well, Allustan is an
old man. His heart is a little dicky and his knees are bad. By the book
he should be totally ok, but he's - well, not 100%. Still: there's  no
reason not to continue, and pressing reason go speak with Marzena. So
long as nothing else happens, he should be fine.
</p>
<p class="smaller">
(we totally forgot to roll for secondary poison damage)
</p>
<p>

Next day and night pass without incident. As they approach Blackwall
Keep, however, it becomes clear that all is not well. There is blood and
smoke on the air - the smells of battle. The party move cautiously
towards  the keep. Observing carefully from a distance, they see that
the keep is surrounded by six groups of five lizardmen - a small army.
Allustan makes a decision. He is not fit to take part in a battle what
with the dodgy  knee and all, not to mention some residual queasiness
from the spiders. "Get into the keep and reinforce the garrison, I will
go organise a relief force." When the party nod their understanding, he
takes out a horribly expensive scroll of Teleport (break glass to use -
emergencies only), reads the incantation and vanishes.
</p>
<p class="smaller">
In all honesty, this party could probably trounce the entire force
without breaking sweat. But that's metagaming.
</p>
<p>

The party noisily debate what to do, but luckily are a fair way back.
Eventually, a plan is settled on. Flash will create an illusion to draw
away part of the force, then they will batter though the remaining
lizardmen to the keep.
</p>
<p>

With a wave and an incantation, Flash calls up a convincing display of a
column of knights coming to relieve the keep, out at the very limits of
the spell's range. Half the lizardmen go to face this threat. The
remainder fan out somewhat to ensure that no-one escapes from the tower.
The lizardmen reach the illusion. The party only has a few rounds before
they return, so they break for the tower. Arn and Tom lead the way,
along the road. A shortcut across the hill might be preferable, but the
tower is fortified with spikes jutting out of the ground. They engage
one group - killing all of them including the commander of the attack.
They  engage and kill most of a second group nearer to the tower. The
survivors retreat and join the third group that had not run off to
battle the illusion.
</p>
<p>

The keep's garrison admit the party. Wasting no time on pleasantries,
the spellcasters ascend the stairs to take advantage of the
second-storey balcony, and the fighters head outside. The rest of the
lizardmen are  returning, but Arn and Tom cut down some more lizardmen
and without their commander the morale of the attacking force breaks.
The casters throw a spell or two out of pique, but it's all over. There
is one remaining  leader among the lizardmen - obviously a shaman of
some kind. Tom and Arn subdue him and drag him inside.
</p>
<p>

Within, the garrison commander and the party brief one another. The
attack came without warning or provocation. There has been almost no
contact with the lizardmen of the Mistmarsh, but the occasional fleeting
contact had been peaceful. Says Bog (one of the common soldiers): "yep,
I saw one of 'em once, clear as day down by the edge of the Mistmarsh. I
waved at him, he waved back, then he was gone. We think Bill saw one
once, too, but we ain't sure."
</p>
<p>

One thing is sure, however. In the initial attack the lizardmen broke
through the tower door and seized four hostages. One of them was
Marzena, with whom the party and Allustan had come so far to confer. And
one other thing is pretty much sure. Waiting for the relief is not an
option. The tribe that attacked -for whatever reason - are savage. If
Marzena and the others are not rescued without undue delay, they will be
killed and eaten.
</p>
<p>

But first, there is their prisoner. And Flash - a changeling beguiler
who speaks draconic.
</p>
<p class="smaller">

Well! How much can they learn from their captive? Why did the
lizardmen attack? What's changed? Who's responsible? Where have they
taken their prisoners, and will they really kill and eat them? All these
answers and  more may or may not be forthcoming next week, depending on
Flash's luck and skill. Then, of course, there's crossing the swamp,
finding the lizardmen's home, and the actual rescue to think about.
</p>
<p class="smaller">And finally - can Marzena (if she lives) shed a little light on the worm
situation? It's module 3 in the series, and about time the party
discovered something concrete about the annelid menace and the coming
age of despair and wormy destruction. As always, stay tuned!
