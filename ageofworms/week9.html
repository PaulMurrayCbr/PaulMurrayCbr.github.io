<h3>Week 9 - Beshadowed labyrinth. Birds and beasts.</h3><p class="smaller">
Short session this week. I was a bit unwell - still am - and there's not
much to tell, story-wise.
</p>
<p class="smaller">
The party negotiated the <img src="images/TFE-22.png" align="right">Maze of The Shadow - a maze populated with
kenku rogues armed with bows and under a continual <i>Darkness</i>
effect. Regrettably, I completely, completely stuffed up the tactics. I
mean utterly. Partly from being ill, partly from it being a difficult encounter to run, and partly sheer inexperience.

A  kenku would move into view and shoot at the party. It would be within
30' in order to make a sneak attack. On their turn the party (of course)
would move over to the kenku and clobber it. Duh. What I <em>should</em>
have done is <i><span style="color:red">&hellip;text deleted - email me if you are a DM and want to know&hellip;</span></i>.

So next time that the party are in this situation, they will have a much rougher time of it I assure you. It wasn't all bad, however. The weasels gave Frith some unpleasant moments and that was cool. They latch on, you know, and do constitution damage.</p>

Oh well. The party will definitely die next week.<img src="images/TFE-24.png" align="right">
