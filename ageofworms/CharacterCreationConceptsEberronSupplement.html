options for characters belonging to Eberrons unique races:</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Changelings</B>: There
are a few changelings in Diamond Lake. Most have ties to the Midnight
Salute; Purple Prose may actually be a changeling herself. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Kalashtar</B>: A
kalashtar seer has had precognitive visions of a terrible disaster,
but she cannot narrow the focus to determine its exact nature. A
kalashtar may have been sent to the town to watch for any signs of
this rising evil. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Shifers</B>: There should
be a number of shifters at the Bronzewood Lodge, but shifer rangers
and scouts could also be attached to the garrison; the question is
whether the character is a child of the wilds, or a member of Brelish
society. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Warforged</B>: The
warforged are tireless workers with no need for food, and as such
they would be welcome in the mines. However, established miners might
see a new wave of warforged as a threat to job security. A former
warforged soldier might continue to serve at the garrison. Or perhaps
a war- forged adventurer has become fascinated with the ruins: as a
member of a race with no history, he is intrigued by the remnants of
fallen nations.
