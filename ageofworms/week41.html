<h3>Week 41 - The bigger they are</h3>
<p class="smaller">
Well, I got the sulks again because the party totally disposed of my big monster. As Morgan is out of town, we swapped in a monk instead of Gauthakan just to see what would happen (we’ll award G the usual XP - suspension of disbelief and all that). Bleh. The monk sucked as hard as everyone says they do.
</p>

<p>
The sudden shift in environment is shockingand overwhelming for a moment.The sound of the raging tempest is gone,replaced by a gentle wind carrying birdsongsand the drone of buzzing insects.The sky above is overcast, yet it doesn’tseem ready to storm.</p><p>
The edge of a sprawling black forest,dense and overgrown, fills the view in onedirection. Tall trees sag with branches heavywith moss, their dark eaves dropping tothe ground in some places. From withincomes a cacophony of insects and singingbirds. Now and then, a ghostly green glowappears within, only to fade moments later,as if whatever creature was generating thelight was afraid to be seen.
</p><p>
In the other directions grassy hills rise.Opposite the forest, these hills eventuallybecome a range of rocky, barrenmountains. A flash of brilliant lightningignites the sky above the mountains fora moment, and the distant peal of mutedthunder echoes down the slopes a fewmoments after.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The party orient themselves after the plane shift. The casters among them become aware that this plane is not coterminous with the etheral plane or the plane of shadow: Dimension Door, Teleport, Shadow X spells won’t work here. But the plane is infused with positive energy: unlike on Eberron, Resurrection and Regeneration will work. Cool.
</p><p>
After a few moments, some dudes step out of the trees.
</p><div class="cutscene">
<div class="img450"><img src="images/LLR-WildWatcher.png">
This tall, gallant figure stands bedecked inglimmering gossamer armor, with a cloak ofvicious nettles draped across his shoulders.A halo of churning insects swirls about hishead. He wields a wicked barbed spear in bothhands, and four poles fan out from the platesof armor across his upper back. Attached atthe end of each pole is a banner, one fiery redfringed with bright crimson flames, anothertranslucent white leaving a trail of cloud inits wake as it dances on the wind, a third deepbrown and cracked like parched earth, and thelast blue as the ocean on a cloudless day andfrothing with bubbles.
</div>
“I am Tylanthros, guardian of this realm.We are the Last Resort, as surely as the treesand stones and sea and air around you. Weprotect the secrets of this island from alltrespassers. You have mastered the portalof storms, and therefore must be brave, butit remains to be seen if you belong here atall. Why have you come to Last Resort?”
</div><p>

 Asking the party’s business, the party say they are chasing a bad guy. The watchers take the position that it’s not their business too interfere. Of course: that’s not really why the party is here. They are here because they are looking for the location of Dragotha’s phylactery. Eventually, someone happens to mention that they are looking for info, and another goddamn cutscene ensues.
</p>
<p class="smaller">
Reading these things out is a drag. DMs thinking of running this adventure: print out the cutscene text and get the players to read it themselves.
</p>

<div class="cutscene">
<p>
“You seek the Fountain, although you donot yet realize it. The Fountain of Dreamsis linked to all things in Last Resort. Theearth, the dark trees of the Doomshroud,the clouds above, my life and that of mybrothers are a part of it. If the waters areconsumed, the Order of the Storm’s rite isundone. The secrets kept from the worldwill be released, and the great creatures oflegend imprisoned here on this isle shallbe unleashed upon the Material Planeonce more. You say you are heroes? Thisremains to be seen. Accomplish four tasksand prove yourselves to be the heroes ofold returned. The Fountain shall not bedespoiled lightly.”</p><p>
The strange creature looks at his fourbrothers, then back to you. “The Fountainof Dreams shall know those destined forits gift s in but one way. It will know themby the <strong>Trials of Tilagos</strong>. Survive thesetrials, and you may slake your thirst onwhat you seek. Fail, and Last Resort shallbe your grave. I am Tylanthros, and thefi rst trial is the <strong>Claiming of Krathanos’sGolden Belt</strong>.”</p><p>
A second of the quartet of creaturesspeaks up next. “I am Beskawahn, andthe second trial is the <strong>Silence of theDoomshroud’s Mournful Song</strong>.”
</p><p>The third speaks. “I am Thadimar, andthe third trial is the <strong>Death of the ThornVale Nightmare</strong>.”</p><p>
Finally, the last creature speaks. “I amSayren-Lei, and the final trial is the <strong>Harvestof the Living Feather of the Roc King</strong>.”</p><p>
Tylanthros speaks again. “These trialscomplete, return here and we shall showyou the Fountain of Dreams. Until then,we shall watch. And wait.”
</p>
</div>

<p>
“Either that, or bring us each a shrubbery, then chop down the tallest tree on this island with this herring”.
</p><p>
Having given their quest, the watchers exit. Flash tries to persuade them to stick around a little and explain some more, but they are not persuaded.

Well! The party resort to their tried and true <i>Locate&nbsp;Creature/Find&nbsp;The&nbsp;Path</i> trick. Darl Querthos’ current location is “Nest of Elvis the Roc King, Bloodfeather Peak, Library of Last Resort”. As “Bloodfeather Peak” is the name of a unique location, <i>Find&nbsp;The&nbsp;Path</i> works and points them “thataway”. As they have not prepared travel spells, Flash summons some mounts. Good enough.
</p><p>
Although the spell expires well before they get there, “Thataway” turns out to be good enough, as Bloodfeather Peak becomes visible in the distance - a massive volcanic plug, a natural tower. The party scale it - I forget how - and on top is a dead Roc in a small lake of blood. Damn. They decide to use <i>Reincarnation</i>, but first to do a <i>Speak&nbsp;with&nbsp;Dead</i> and <i>Speak&nbsp;with&nbsp;Animals</i> to ensure the Elvis is willing.
</p><p>
Well, Elvis ain’t that bright, but he agrees. He reincarnates as a Giant Eagle, and the party hope that one of his feathers will satisfy the watchers. But what now? The party decide to use a <i>Commune</i>. They ask the gods a series of questions, and get some answers.
</p><p class="smaller">
I got to role-play the gods for this bit. It was a little weird. Bevis wrote down the questions they were asking, and was totally going to mail them to me so I could paste them in here.

<div class="img450"><img src="images/LLR-TilagosIsland-2.png"></div>
<div class="sidel">The weathered walls of the keep are tornand ragged. They appear to have beenbattered down on more than one occasion,their chipped stone blocks rebuilthaphazardly into makeshift structureswith little integrity. Four crumbling towersoverlook the outer courtyard. Thearchway providing entrance into thecompound looms empty, its iron portcullisnow nothing more than a heap oftwisted black metal lying on the groundnearby.
</div>
The gods tell them that Kranthos lives on the coastal bit, so they sweep it in <i>Wind&nbsp;Walk</i> form. There is a structure there, towards the end. An old and battered keep, with a sleeping giant. Wearing a belt. The party buff up, and enter. Kranthos (for it is he) rouses and welcomes them: “More guests! Welcome to the Keep of the Shackled Conqueror!”. 
</p><p>
Negotiations ensue. Kranthos wants off the island. Frith notes that he is, in fact, insane and unstable. Negotoations break down. Flash casts an illusion of a <i>Gate</i> spell, and when Kranthos steps through it, melee starts. But before too much else happens, Flash casts <i>Final&nbsp;Rebuke</i> and Kranthos rolls a 7. And that’s that.
</p><p>
The party scores a belt. And some loot.
</p>

<p class="smaller">
Well, that’s high-level 3.5 for you: save or die rules the day. As for the Trials of Tilagos: the party are two out of four. Well, one out of four - the “Living Feather” is problematical. But where’s Qarl Querthos? Running about the Island, no doubt. And not a lot of a clue, yet, about where the other two challenges might lie. Sure hope this “library” is worth it.
