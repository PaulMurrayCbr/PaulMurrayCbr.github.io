		<p>The party continues to explore the upland around Aycenia's
			tree. The healer, Volka, stays at the tree for a bit. There's a snek
			and a couple of spiders. Standard stuff which they deal with without
			issue.</p>
		<p>But at night, there is movement in the trees.</p>

		<div class="ooc">
			<p>Volka's player was out for the session.</p>
			<p>The wandering monster roll of 15% indicated encounters at
				midnight and at dawn - unlucky. I opted for one slightly more
				powerful encounter. Technically CR4, which is a challenging
				encounter for a standard 4-member level 3 party.</p>
		</div>

		<p>A tiger! It's coming for Kraig, the halfling - a common
			mistake. But Snid noisily raises the alarm, and the tiger goes for
			him.</p>
		<p>Snid is up a tree, but that is no problem whatever for a tiger.
			As the rest of the party wakes and variously gets up the tree (Kraig
			mounted on his goat, which has a natural climb speed), the tiger
			swipes at Snid once, and then makes a full attack - claw, claw, bite.
			The claw attacks are enough to reduce Snid to unconscious and
			bleeding out.</p>
		<p>The tiger bites Snid, and they tumble out of the tree, landing
			awkwardly. Astonishingly, the fall is bad enough to kill the tiger.
			But it doesn't matter, because the bite, or the fall, or both, render
			Snid messily and thoroughly dead.</p>

		<div class="ooc">
			<p>The tiger fumbled the bite. But we are using the crit fumble
				deck, and the card was "normal damage, but double damage to you".
				applying this put Snid at -22, which is well over negative his
				constitution and RAW means he is dead, dead, no mistake about it
				dead.</p>
			<p>At which point, we have to ask what kind of game I am running.
				Snid's player rather likes Snid. Not only that, I killed his
				character in Phandalin with a very over-the-top attack by a bugbear.
				There are a variety of DM magic things that could be done. We could
				opt to handwave the fumble, but that leaves the tiger alive and
				still attacking Snid. I suggested half the overkill as 11 points of
				con damage, although that's making up rules on the spot.</p>
			<p>
				Did I mess things up? Should I have has the tiger spread its attacks
				around? It's just - lame as it sounds, I really don't think that's
				what a tiger would have done. I mean, I despise "its what my
				character would have done" as an excuse for playing like a dick, but
				&hellip; but come on! <u>Tiger!</u> It's a tiger. This party did a
				lion previously, when they were level 3.
			</p>
			<p>Nobody wants Snid dead. But nobody wants a creampuff campaign,
				either. I mean - as far as I know.</p>
			<p>In the end, the players found a solution that works.</p>

		</div>

		<p>
			The party collect the various bits of Snid in shock. But then they
			remember - part of the loot aboard the <cite>Jenivere</cite> was a
			scroll of <cite class="spell">Raise Dead</cite>, which they have not
			yet used. Volka has it in her bag, back at Aycenia's tree.
		</p>

		<p>
			Tomorrow, it will be 76 days since the wreck of the <cite>Jenivere</cite>
			on Smuggler's Shiv.
