		<h3>Game 3</h3>
		<div class="ooc">
			<p>Well! Public holiday, so we started a little earlier and the
				party got a heck of a lot done. Ended at an appropriate place.</p>
			<p>People are levelling up, and seeing Pathfinder I from the POV
				of new players - yes, it's outrageously complicated. Part of the
				reason is power creep. As time went by, Paizo introduced new
				mechanics because their players were familiar with all the old ones.
				We have APG and UC in play, so we have an archeologist bard, a
				cavalier, and a ninja. I'm unfamiliar with animal companions, and
				with the Ki points system for ninjas, so that means there is nobody
				at the table with any clue. When I built Horse, I didn't give him
				HP, so he has been struggling along with 2hp because he's 2HD and
				has a +1 Con bonus, which HeroLab calculated.</p>
			<p>Happily, level 2 introduces class features which mostly come
				out of the box, so players don't need to make too many choices.</p>
			<p>The module requires players to scout out a location for a new
				camp and then move to a new base. It gives a realistic feel to the
				whole problem of being stranded on an island with dense jungle. I'm
				only doing wandering monsters once per day - that is, rolling the
				checks, but stopping after we get that first one. And we have mostly
				downplayed the random disease checks, as the penalties are really,
				really savage. Which is not to say that it might not be a thing a
				bit later on. Maybe I should only use the new, exotic maladies for
				special occasions and just go with good old Filth Fever most of the
				time.</p>
		</div>

		<p>Kraig is dreaming.</p>
		<div class="dream">You’re sitting down in the galley aboard the
			Jenivere, getting ready for your meal. The ship’s cook has given you
			a steaming bowl of soup, but you drop your spoon. You see that the
			deck below is covered with seawater up to your ankles, and your
			dropped spoon has sunk into the water and washed out to sea through a
			hole. You’re forced to lift your delicious bowl of soup to your lips
			and drink. But something big goes into your mouth as you do so, and
			you feel a sharp bite on your tongue. You drop the bowl, only to
			reveal a serpent had hidden in your soup that now dangles from your
			tongue as it chews furiously. You start awake, biting your own tongue
			in an attempt to bite through the snake’s body.</div>

		<p>Our heroes continue east and south, heading hopefully for a
			lighthouse built by the House of Thrune - a Chelaxian noble house -
			somewhere in the south. And being sure to farm every single hex for
			its precious 10xp.</p>
		<p>Volka is out of action with the Blinding Sickness, but Jask
			manages to nurse her back to health after a few days.</p>
		<p>They move in stages, exploring forward, setting up camp, and
			then moving main camp to the new location. Some days they explore
			miles of terrain, some only a little. The island is cut by
			fast-moving, deep streams resulting from the heavy rainfall. Snid
			constructs a bridge of sorts, but moving it around the jungle is
			difficult.</p>
		<p>There are wrecks all around the island, and two of their
			companions - Jask and Gelik - are looking for two in particular. But
			they need to wait for low tide to do so.</p>
		<div class="ooc">
			<p>
				Low tide occurs twice per day, and advances by one hour per day
				(giving us a month of 24 days, I suppose but whatever). On day 1, it
				was at 10am/pm, which is when they were able to explore the <cite>Jenivere</cite>.
				As Smugglers Shiv is tropical, the sun rises and sets promptly at 6.
				Having to organise overland movement around the tide is another
				thing that gives this module great "feel".
			</p>
		</div>
		<p>
			They sight and explore three wrecks, but these prove to be the <cite>Golden
				Bow</cite>, the <cite>Tears of Grog</cite>, and the <cite>Bloody
				Doll</cite>, all of which prove to be empty although one does have a little
			loot on board. The group has money, but no place to spend it.
		</p>
		<p>They fight off another one of the island's large snakes - a
			constrictor this time. There are some more strange happenings:</p>
		<p>One ghost in the surf appears a little more substantial than
			the rest - a hook-handed skeleton of a man with a captians hat,
			calling for "Ashmara", which a Knowledge (local) check determines to
			be a woman's name. But it is night: a bad time to go swimming in the
			treacherous surf around Smuggler's Shiv, so there is nothing more to
			be determined.</p>
		<p>At one point they see in the sky far above them some sort of
			bat-winged creature, not bat, or dinosaur, or dragon, or anything
			else familiar. Something about it though, even at that distance, is
			&hellip; unsettling.</p>
		<p>They turn inland, heading towards the cove in the centre of the
			island, skirting around a massive stand of some razor-leaved plant.
			The terrain here is a little gentler, but the inhabitants are not -
			giant crabs, massive things with huge pincers and tough shells.</p>
		<div class="imgright">
			<img src="YellowMuskCreeper_Thrall.png" width="100%">
		</div>
		<p>They come across some sort of abandoned camp, rough shelters
			falling to ruin in the sun, sand, and jungle. Standing on the shore
			is - a woman? A zombie? Some sort of plant creature? All three
			perhaps. It turns to attack, but it seems the sun, sand and jungle
			have not been kind to it, and after a couple of sling hits, the
			momentum of turning to attack somehow manages to shear it in half and
			it dissolves into disconnected plant matter and a few old bones.</p>
		<div class="ooc">
			<p>We are playing with the Paizo critical fumble deck, b/c chaos
				is good.</p>
		</div>
		<p>And at the south end of the camp, a path! A path! An actual,
			usable trail in the jungle, the branches macheted out of the way,
			tracked by feet!</p>
		<p>Human feet.</p>
		<p>Camp is five hours away, back though the jungle. It is Day 19
			on Smuggler's Shiv.</p>
