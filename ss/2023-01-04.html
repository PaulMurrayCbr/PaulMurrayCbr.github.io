		<h2>Part 1: Souls for Smuggler's Shiv</h2>
		<h3>Game 14</h3>
		<div class="ooc">
			<p>Christmas break. We had I think a talky session for Game 14,
				movie night (and levelling up Volka), and then another session for
				Game 15.</p>
			<p>Dinner was Jatz and dip and pizza.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="gameday">Day 52 - 59</div>

		<p>
			The party spend the entire week dealing with Ghoul Fever and
			repairing the lighthouse. Each day, the afflicted members take an
			alchemical Antiplague, some of them being the ones they looted from
			Nyalathi's hut. Volka each day prepares <i class="spell">Lesser
				Restore</i> to keep the worst-affected alive, as <i class="spell">Cure
				Disease</i> is currently beyond her. She and Jask also provide medical
			case for the afflicted, using the contents of the healer's kits from
			the hut to do so.
		</p>
		<div class="ooc">
			<p>
				Ghoul fever does Dex and Con damage. If you die from Con damage, you
				become a ghoul. DC 14, but requires two <em>consecutive</em> saves.
				So, the <i class="spell">Lesser Restore</i> spells were to stave off
				that ability damage while the characters waited for lucky rolls.
			</p>
			<p>The effect of long-term care is that if the carer makes a Heal
				check, the patient gets a +4 to their save. The effect of antiplague
				is that the patient rolls twice and takes the better roll. Neither
				accomplish much if people insist on rolling 2s and 3s. And remember:
				Con damage reduces your fort save.</p>
			<p>So, it took all week before the three afflicted characters
				were ok. Went through a lot of antiplague and healer's kit charges.
				Always nice to see players running through consumables.</p>
		</div>
		<p>There were a couple of notable events.</p>
		<p>Pezcock, in gratitude for dealing with the cannibals who ate
			his human friends, grants the party some training in jungle lore. The
			party may spend an hour making a survival check, looking for useful
			berries and other items. If they succeed in a survival check, they
			acquire ingredients for 1d4 of:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Antiplague; or</li>
			<li>Antivenom; or</li>
			<li>Insect repellent; or</li>
			<li>One refill on a healer's kit.</li>
		</ul>

		<div class="ooc">
			<p>Each of the NPCs had a quest reward, seemed a little unfair
				not to have Pezcock have something. Strictly speaking, I should make
				the characters do Craft (Alchemy) checks to use the ingredients. But
				(DM Handwave) here on Smuggler's Shiv Pezcock's info is very
				specific. Maybe if they wind up in other jungles the survival check
				might be more difficult, and the ingredients less familiar.</p>
			<p>I think the quest reward is good but not game-breaking.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="imgright">

		</div>

		<p>Oh, and there was this other thing.</p>
		<p>
			The winged &hellip; <em>thing</em> that they have seen from time to
			time flying around the island flies over their camp and drops
			something directly at their feet, then screeches and flies off.
		</p>

		<div class="imginline">
			<img src="006-055 PZO9037 Shiv-13.png" width="100%">
		</div>

		<p>The party fall to discussing. What could this mean? Clearly the
			beast is intelligent, and clearly it is not friendly. But the
			Cavalier, Kraig, sees the reaction of his trusty riding-goat "Horse",
			and to him the matter is plain.</p>
		<p>This is a challenge.</p>

		<div class="gameday">Day 60</div>
		<p>
			After a week of work, they light up the lighthouse. And wonder of
			wonders, that day a ship drops anchor well off shore. She is the <cite>Red
				Gull</cite>, a whaler bound for Eleder - the castaway's original
			destination. The ship's jolly-boat ferries all aboard, even Pezcock.
			The law of the sea prevails: castaways are to be rescued.
		</p>
		<p>
			And as the <cite>Red Gull</cite> makes way, the castaways gather on
			the stern to bid the island farewell. Kraig, though, with a
			determined "I'll be back". And then - then the clouds gather, and a
			mighty, mighty crack of lightning strikes the rocky east of the
			island. Somewhere within her soul, Volka hears Gozreh wake and
			demand: "Who Dares This?". She feels the sea stir and move, compelled
			by some magic, but far away, already vanishing over the horizon.
			Still. Such an outrage must be answered.
		</p>
		<p>Eleder is only 10 miles away. By midafternoon, they are back in
			civilisation. The castaways make their goodbyes, and several have
			business in the city. After all - they had set sail here in the first
			place for some reason. But for whatever reason our party elects to
			stay together. They do what every D&amp;D party does when they hit
			town.</p>
		<p>They go shopping.</p>

		<div class="ooc">
			<p>Shopping, shopping, shopping. You all know how it is.</p>
		</div>

		<h3>Game 15</h3>
		<div class="gameday">Day 61 - 65</div>

		<div class="ooc">
			<p>We needed some in-game justification for the party to return
				to the island, and also everyone seems to be a little low on loot.
				Book says a level 4 character should have about 4k of bling, but
				everyone is rocking only 1.5-2k . Or that's what they told me, at
				least, and I believe 'em.</p>
			<p>The next module in the campaign: Racing to Ruin, has some
				politics and factional shenanigans in Eleder. So I decided to make
				use of that. A little foreshadowing.</p>
		</div>

		<p>They party spend three days in Eleder. And over that time, they
			have a series of visitors who are very, very interested in a group
			who has been castaway on Smuggler's Shiv and gotten out alive.</p>

		<p>
			Gelik drops by. With him is the local guildmaster of the Pathfinders.
			It seems Gelik has managed to persuade the guildmaster that the <cite>Nightvoice</cite>
			may very will be on the island. Gelik is &hellip; shall we say "on
			probation" at the moment. The guildmaster is happy to put up a bounty
			for the mission: a wand of <i class="spell">Cure Moderate Wounds</i>
			and a <i>Bag of Holding</i>. He is not, however, willing to supply
			mooks, and Gelik is not keen on other pathfinders being part of his
			expedition. The whole point of finding the <cite>Nightvoice</cite> is
			to get the credit for it and erase certain past difficulties within
			the guild pertaining to himself.
		</p>

		<p>
			Ayeris drops by. With her is one of the Free Captains of The
			Shackles. A certain "Salty Jim", once "The Devil of the Sea".
			Smuggler's Shiv is well known to the captain, as is how sailors
			coming to grief on its shores are bound to haunt the surf. He and the
			other captains have done a bit of a whip-around, and offer the party
			a small chest of gold and jewels if they will return there and find
			away to free the ghosts or lay them to rest. But he won't lend mooks
			to the party either. Sailors are a superstitious lot, rightly so in a
			fantasy setting, and there's not one in a thousand miles would dream
			of setting foot on Smuggler's Shiv. Even the rowers in the <cite>Red
				Gull's</cite> jolly-boat refused to set foot in the surf.
		</p>
		<p>Ayeris herself is still looking for viper vine berries, and
			asks to accompany the party back to the isle.</p>
		<p>
			Ishoru drops by. He has with him a certain gentleman, a trader with
			the Aspis Consortium. The consortium is very, very, <i>very</i>
			interested in a usable port on an unclaimed island not 10 miles from
			Eleder. Particularly an island known to be unapproachable from any
			other direction. The Lord Protector of Eleder will probably claim the
			island, but if they can get the party to sell them the cannibal camp,
			well - there will be legal wrangling for years, of course, but in the
			meantime there will be profit to be made.
		</p>
		<p>
			The consortium will act immediately to establish a trade port: 20
			guards, masons and carpenters, overseers and managers, merchants. The
			idea is to establish <i>fait accompli</i> before the government can
			act. In return for the title, the consortium is prepared to offer a
			20% discount on goods up to 2000gp worth of discount, to be redeemed
			within 2 years. But the merchant gets a little greedy, and phrases it
			as 20% discount on 2000gp - 400gp each. The party ain't going for it.
		</p>
		<div class="ooc">
			<p>I was hoping they'd go for it and get scammed by the Aspis
				Consortium. Oh well.</p>
		</div>
		<p>Sasha does not drop by. Nyx is not surprised by this,
			considering who Sasha is connected with.</p>
		<p>
			Finally, Jask drops by. With him is a well-dressed gnome and a couple
			of beefy, armed goons in livery. Jask thanks the party for helping to
			clear his name with the documents they found aboard the <cite>Brine
				Demon</cite> and introduces his companion. His companion proves to be the
			Lord Protector's cartographer, who is very interested in their map.
			But the map is somewhat incomplete. Negotiations ensue. The
			cartographer has authority to offer weapons and armour, primarily.
			Eventually, the party agrees to return to the island and complete the
			map in exchange for:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A suit of Vanara whipwood armour, taken from His Lordship's
				museum. The museum features a number of items taken from the local
				subhumans as part of the grand effort of extending the benefits of
				civilisation across the jungles of Sargava.</li>
			<li>A suit of barding, suitable for a goat.</li>
			<li>A nice light crossbow for Jack P.</li>
			<li>A <u>very</u> nice magical katana.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>They settle on the armour and the crossbow for the map as it is
			now (the cartographer has come prepared to make a copy), and the rest
			should the party be able to fill in the rest of the map. The goat
			barding will take a little while to prepare, and His Lordship is
			certainly not parting with 4k worth of magic weapon for anything less
			than the Full Monty.</p>
		<div class="ooc">
			<p>
				I offered a +2 katana: +1 and a special to be determined, but I'll
				say now most emphatically not <i>keen</i>, although I think that's
				+2 anyway.
			</p>
		</div>
		<p>And then it's back to the Aspis Consortium. Negotiations ensue
			once more. The issue with the amount is cleared up, and the final
			deal is:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>20% discount on 10kgp worth of items each, offer vaid for 2
				years, terms and conditions apply.</li>
			<li>The Aspis Consortium settlement on Smuggler's Shiv to be
				named "Port Jenevere".</li>
			<li>Lodging and board at Port Jenevere, for the signatories
				only, for not more than 10 years from today.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>in exchange for title to the cannibal camp and structures
			therin and ""surrounds", whatever that might mean. The party sign.
			Yes, not everyone was present, but enough to grant a veneer of
			legality, which is all the consortium needs (and more than they
			usually operate with).</p>
		<p>And so, back to Smuggler's Shiv.</p>

		<p>
			The party return to Smuggler's Shiv aboard the <cite>Fair
				Trader</cite>. They resume filling in their map, mapping the south edge of
			the isand. At one point, one of the party attempts to order about the
			consortium crew, and quickly discover that the people of the Aspis
			Consortium are strictly business. The camp is theirs, now.
		</p>
		<p>First, the party check the caves under the camp. They are empty
			- the ghouls ate everything edible, and they are gone now. Anything
			they had, they wore on them.</p>
		<p>So, it's back to exploring and mapping. Three days in, they
			make camp. Tomorrow morning, It will be day 69.</p>
