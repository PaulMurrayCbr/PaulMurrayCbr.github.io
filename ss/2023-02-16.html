		<h3>Game 18</h3>

		<div class="ooc">
			<p>I think I skipped a day.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="gameday">Day 77, 78</div>

		<p>The party buries Snid under the Dryad's tree. They spend a day
			or two healing from the tiger attack, and then head back to Port
			Jenivere. Tragically, back at the trading post there is a person
			waiting for them. A Vanara monk, Kiegh, who is Snid's brother.</p>
		<p>Kiegh, however, takes the news remarkably well, and opts to
			join the party.</p>
		<div class="ooc">
			<p>So, Frodo and Sam get out of Mordor and back to Merry, Pippin,
				and Aragorn in a few short words.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="gameday">Day 79-81</div>
		<p>They pop by Snid's grave and resume mapping. There's a snek at
			one point, guarding an ancient pillar, but eventually they run out of
			convenient hexes and decide that it's finally time to grow a pair and
			head out to fungus island, which they have been putting off since
			Game 7, back in early November.</p>
		<div class="gameday">Day 82-83</div>
		<div class="boxtext">
			<div class="title">
				The <cite class="ship">Nightvoice</cite>
			</div>

			An ancient wreck lies wedged between a pair of rocks here, yet
			despite its age, the ruined sailing ship at first seems in relatively
			good condition. The ship has no color to its lines, and is completely
			covered in a layer of soft gray mold. Even its sails appear fully
			intact, although what hangs from the spars is not canvas but sheets
			of thick, pale fungus. Several thick ropes of fungus connect the
			ship’s upper deck to the island almost like crude rope bridges.
		</div>

		<p>
			The island, although creepy AF, is not large. The fungus seems to
			have spawned <a
				href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/plants/vegepygmy">vegepygmies</a>.
			However, these simply are not a threat to a 4th-level party of six.
			On the west side of fungus island, they see a wreck offshore, covered
			with fungus - sheets and ropes of it, and a bridge of fungus
			connecting the wreck to the island.
		</p>
		<p>Crossing the fungus ropes is not difficult, but somehow Jack P
			and Volka manage to absolutely stuff it up. Jack P is left dangling
			by a belay rope, but Volka disappears into the surf.</p>
		<p>In all the chaos, however, one or two of them do manage to spot
			the nameplate of the ship.</p>

		<h3>Game 19</h3>
		<div class="gameday">Day 83 cont'</div>
		<div class="ooc">Our cleric was away, so &hellip;</div>
		<p>
			Volka has sunk beneath the waves, she is gone. But Jack P is tied off
			to a rope and being battered by the surf. How will he escape? Well,
			it turns out to be super easy, barely an inconvenience. Jack has a
			wand of <i class="spell">Enlarge Person</i>. With a zap, he manages
			the waves reasonably easily, and the party pile aboard ship.
		</p>
		<p>Up at deck level, they go through the captains quarters,
			finding there what looks to be a logbook. Jack will need some hours
			to make sense of it, as it is in bad condition. Below deck, they find
			a &hellip; situation:</p>


		<div class="dream">
			<p>The Nightvoice is now the main lair of what its crew have
				become—a tribe of vegepygmies led by a hulking thug that was once
				the ship’s cook.</p>
			<p>The Nightvoice’s cargo hold is a hideous scene—the skeletal
				remains of the ship’s crew lie enshrined here. In all there are 19
				bodies here, each consisting of a mound of bones caked over with
				mold; each sits amid a small circle of personal objects, teeth,
				coins, 9 bits of jewelry, and other objects that the crewmember
				valued in life. The vegepygmies honor these bodies as their “birth
				corpses” in a crude form of ancestor worship.</p>
		</div>
		<p>But, there is little to tell. These creatures are not a threat
			to this party now. The uncover some loot, but the main thing is the
			logbook, which Gellik is after.</p>

		<div class="boxtext">
			<div class="title">The Fungus God</div>
			A fifty-foot-high pillar of fungus-covered rock thrusts up from the
			surf here, angling away from the main body of the larger island to
			the west. The rock is connected to the main island by thick tangles
			of fibrous fungus, perhaps providing a way to cross the churning surf
			below.
		</div>

		<p>They explore the silent island further. On the east side is an
			odd pinnacle of rock, which they had noticed previously from across
			the bay.</p>
		<p>
			They cross the bridge without incident, and within the cave is a <a
				href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/fiendish/">fiendish</a>
			<a
				href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/plants/fungus-violet/">violet
				fungus</a>. A skeleton is plastered against the back wall, covered with
			fungus. It twitches unsettlingly. Unhappily, there is not much to
			tell about the fight. I think it did get one of our heroes with its
			rot attack, but really, they dealt with it pretty handily.
		</p>
		<div class="ooc">
			<p>Shoulda put three in there.</p>
		</div>
		<p>The skeleton falls apart into bone and dead fungus, but atop it
			is a captain's hat.</p>

		<div class="gameday">Day 84-91</div>
		<p>
			Having dealt with fungus island and the dryad's quest, they head to
			Pezcock's crab, and resume mapping for the Lord Protector of Eleder.
			Day 85, they take a detour and pick up some Viper Vine berries for
			Aerys. The druid, Widmanstätten, has <i>Trackless Step</i> and the
			thorns are no barrier. He simply goes into the thicket and comes out
			with a double handful of berries.
		</p>
		<p>
			On the way, Jack P finds time to examine the logbook. It seems the
			crew of the <cite class="ship">Nightvoice</cite> found a strange pod
			which infected them with russet mold. The captain decided to "carry
			the blasphemous pod up to a rock spire to the east of this island",
			explaining the whole situation.
		</p>
		<p>
			Everything is going great, they deal with a couple of the island's
			Dimorphodons, but on day 89 they have a run-in with a group of six of
			the island's <a
				href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/magical-beasts/shocker-lizard">shocker
				lizards</a>. This rather badly messes them up, so they return to Port
			Jenivere for R&amp;R.

		<h3>Game 20</h3>
		<div class="gameday">Day 91-92</div>
		<div class="ooc">This week, our druid was away.</div>
		<p>Back at Port Jenevere, a welcome surprise: Volka is alive, safe
			and sound by the will of Gozreh who, no doubt, has borne her through
			the waves and back to port. Volka remembers nothing, or at least is
			saying nothing about it. Meanwhile, Widmanstätten opts to go back to
			the Dryad's tree and do druid stuff.</p>
		<p>
			They give the berries to Aerys, who is happier than she lets on. Over
			the course of the conversation, she reveals that she is writing an
			epic poem, which they take a day to read. The mere reading of this
			poem seems to bolster their will, somehow. They likewise give Gelik
			the log from the <cite class="ship">Nightvoice</cite>. He is somewhat
			more demonstrative, and offers to train them in voice projection and
			proper timing, which they spend the next day doing. They buy some
			stuff, I think, form the consortium trading post, and then it's back
			to mapping.
		</p>
		<p>Aaand at this point, beautiful people, I shall start
			summarizing.</p>
		<p>The party map many hexes, but not much happens.</p>
		<p>
			Day 97, they discover the <cite class="ship">Wavereaper</cite>, but
			there's nothing there.
		</p>
		<p>
			Day 98, they head back to the dryad, and as a reward for clearing the
			silent island of the violet fungus, she grants them a special. She
			teaches Jack P Jungle Rhythms. Once per day, when summoning a monster
			that is arguably a jungle sort of thing, the monster can have the <a
				href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/advanced-creature-cr-1/">Advanced</a>
			template.
		</p>
		<div class="ooc">
			<p>Was considering a +1 staff for Kiegh, but you can just buy
				those. This reward is better than it seems: it scales.</p>
		</div>
		<p>They fight a giant constrictor snake. And they discover a
			rickety bridge across a gorge with a fast-flowing river at the base,
			but they opt not to cross it just yet. They head back to a previously-established camp.</p>
		<p>Tomorrow, it will be 100 days.</p>
		<div class="ooc">
			<p>And that was that. A lot of talky-talk, a lot of
				completionism. Stuff will shortly get real, but the characters don't
				know that.</p>
		</div>
