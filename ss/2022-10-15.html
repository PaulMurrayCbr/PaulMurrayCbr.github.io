		<h3>Game 4</h3>


		<div class="gameday">Day 20 - early morning</div>
		<p>Kraig is dreaming.</p>
		<div class="dream">You’re in a rowboat on the open ocean at
			night. Sitting across you, rowing the boat, is First Mate Alton. He’s
			obviously dead, with the wounds and stings his body displays on the
			wreck of the Jenivere, but still he rows. Eventually, the boat
			reaches an island covered with snakes. Alton waits as you exit the
			boat, standing ankle-deep in snakes, and then he turns and rows back
			out to sea, you assume off to look for more survivors to ferry to
			shore. But Alton never returns, and you wake up just as the snakes
			start to bite&hellip;</div>

		Definitely counting these hexes wrong. There's only 8 hours in a day - you can't explore 9 hexes.
		</div>
		<p>The party opt to explore a plateau south of camp, finding a
			yellow musk creeper glade. While most of the party hack away at three
			creeper zombies, Nyx breathes in a nosefull of pollen and moves
			forward to get zombified. But, the rest of the party hack down the
			thing before she is too far gone. Takes her a few days to recover.</p>
		<p>There is also a giant spider, which might or might not be
			random.</p>
		<p>The party set up a camp ready to be moved into. From this
			vantage point atop the plateau, they sight another wreck. Low tide is
			currently at 5, which is a little to early and a little too late to
			be a good time to explore wrecks, so they opt to wait a day or so.</p>

			Day 23 is eventful. The wreck proves to be the <cite>Brine
				Demon</cite>! The ship is almost empty - looted by its survivors, perhaps,
			much as this party looted the <cite>Jenivere</cite>. In any case, the
			sole "survivor" is an unmoving skeleton with a captain's hat and a
			hook hand, who is clutching a small darkwood coffer. There is also a
			darkwood buckler, somewhere in the mix. The box is locked, but Jack P
			(I think) works out that the captain's hook is actually the key.
		</p>
		<div class="ooc">Nat 20.</div>
		<p>The coffer contains ships logs which, among other things,
			detail the doings of several ship captains and port officials and
			completely exonerate Jask. It also contains a locket, which opens to
			reveal a portrait of a red-haired half-elven woman, titled "Aesmara".</p>
		<div class="ooc">Dun dun duuun!</div>
		<p>Jask is grateful. He doesn't have much, but he offers to teach
			they party several secret mantras known to priests of Nethys, which
			will improve their ability to concentrate on spells in stressful
			situations. They spend day 24 practicing.</p>

			Day 25 is the day the party dig up the location on Ishirou's treasure map. It's a big effort. They dig down
			and after a couple of hours find a heavy wooden platform of some sort. A couple of the party begin to tunnel around it,
			but Kraig takes the direct route and hacks his way through, dropping himself, Snid, and I think Jack P into
			the pit - although Snid's tail comes in handy and he secures a handhold.
		</p>
		<p>
		At the bottom of the pit is seawater, and in the seawater is a pair of sailors who Captain Quellig trapped with his treasure ages ago.
		Actually, he trapped three. But one died first, and the other two were starving, and well &hellp; that kind of thing
		tends to turn one into a ghoul. An aquatic ghoul, in this case. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Happily, these ghouls had just had half a ton of lumber dropped onto them from above and were in bad shape, but they 
		were still ghouls. Jack was soon paralyzed and floating face-down in the water, surviving with a little help from Volka's deity Gozreh, embodiment of the sea.
		</p>
		<p>
		After a bad half a minute, they ghouls were proper dead. But, not without consequence - Jack has contracted Filth Fever from the disgusting 
		water in the pit.
		</p>
		<p>
		And yes, there was fat lewt. Ishirou took a share, and in gratitude not just for the party's help, but for finally showing one of his treasure maps to be an actual real treasure map, he offers to teach the party a few 
		combat tricks. Which they spend day 26 learning.
		</p>
		<div class="ooc">
		The encounter nerfs the ghouls by immediately dropping them to less than half HP. They are still bad news, but
		I have adjusted the xp. Even so, it appears that the party are level 3. I could reduce the hex xp, which has been 980xp
		each &hellip; I mean, 1/3rd of the xp has been hex xp, which isn't part of the module. Perhaps a compromise might be that
		the interior terrain isn't quite as bad as the northern hook. 5xp per, but 1.5 hexes per hour, and visibility is one extra hex. 12 a day bush-bashing not on a path.
		There are around 400 hexes total on the island, so they have knocked out a quarter of them (if we are going to be map completionists).

		<p>
		The night is uneventful. Dawn breaks. It is day 27 on Smuggler's Shiv.
