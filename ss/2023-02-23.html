		<h3>Game 19</h3>

		<div class="gameday">Day 100</div>

		<p>Oh day! Oh day! Oh day of days! Oh day 100, in fact. A notable
			sort of number. Today is the day that our heroes opt to battle the
			Red Mountain Devil.</p>

		<div class='boxtext'>
			<div class="title">Red Mountain</div>
			This low mountain is the highest point on the entire island. Barren
			of vegetation, the jagged rise of rust-red stones juts from the earth
			like an immense scar, providing a vertiginous view of the surrounding
			blue of the seemingly endless ocean.
		</div>

			</p>
		</div>

		<p>The game plan is:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Go to Red Mountain</li>
			<li>Battle the Red Mountain Devil</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Part 1 goes off without a hitch. Part 2 takes a little longer,
			as Mr RMD is not actually at Red Mountain. While there they take note
			of the rocks. The vibrant red colour is not natural and not rust.
			They also spot remnants of cannibal activity: seashells, human bones,
			pentagrams. But the cannibals are all gone.</p>
		<p>Nevertheless, the man of the hour shows up. He targets the most
			unarmoured character for his attack, because if he manages to drain
			blood he gets a considerable buff. Unluckily for him the most
			unarmoured character is Keigh, the monk. It does not go well.</p>
		<p>Meanwhile, Jack P summons a small air elemental which traps him
			in a whirlwind. He is grounded for the round.</p>
		<div class='ooc'>I think you don't get a whirlwind unless the
			air elemental is large or bigger, but RMD rolled a 1 right in front
			of everyone so meh.</div>
		<p>
			Learning his lesson he targets Horse, the goat. He manages to
			grapple, but either Jack or Widmanstäten drops <i class="spell">Liberating
				Command</i> and that's the end of that.
		</p>
		<div class='ooc'>I can hardly complain - as a player doing Paizo
			organised play, I have used that one many, many times.</div>
		<p>
			Volka hits him with <i class="spell">Call Lightning</i>, but in the
			end it's down to Nix, Keigh, and Kraig stabbing and punching him
			until he is dead.
		</p>
		<p>Well! That was super easy! So easy, they opt to explore some
			hexes.</p>
		<div class="gameday">Day 101</div>

		<div class="boxtext">
			<div class="title">The Tide Stone</div>
			Four stone monoliths appearing as jagged stalagmites of rock protrude
			from the grass at the edge of this bluff. A weathered, snakelike rune
			is carved into the inner face of each of these stones, all facing a
			three-foot-high pyramid-shaped block of stone at the center of the
			four surrounding spires. The vegetation and soil surrounding this
			pyramid has been trimmed back and excavated to expose the strange
			block fully to view. The peak of the central pyramid has a cup-shaped
			indentation—channels run down the four sides into empty basins at the
			base of the pyramid.
		</div>

		<p>Day 101 they explore more of Red Mountain. They spot a sunken
			ship in a cove in the interior of the island, and opt to take a look.
			The DM, suspiciously, pulls out a predrawn map of the terrain. There
			is a deep ravine leading down to the cove, and a set of steps and
			bridges going down. More interestingly, there is some sort of
			structure.</p>
		<p>The structure, definitely, is the one mentioned in the caves of
			the mother - that bit where Ieana (presumably) had cleared off one of
			the carvings to read its text:</p>
		<div class="dream" style="font-family: sscorners;">To Command
			the Very Tides to Rise Up and Eschew What Lies Below: Empower the
			Four Sentinel Runes with the Blood of a Thinking Creature Tempered by
			the Kiss of a Serpent’s Tongue. Anoint the Tide Stone with Waters
			Brought from the Sea in a Vessel of Purest Metal. Invoke the Lord’s
			Sacred Name to Wrap His Coils around the Sea Itself that He Might Lay
			Bare What Lies Below and Cast Down Your Enemies on the Waves above.</div>
		<p>Furthermore, this structure has also been partially excavated
			by a trained archeologist. And so, being fully genre-aware of how
			D&amp;D works, they decide to destroy it.</p>
		<div class="ooc">Does anyone else have players like this? Shut
			up. You all do, I know.</div>
		<p>Sadly, the structure is protected by some sort of divine
			nuh-uh, and so they go exploring the local area.</p>

		<div class="boxtext">
			<div class="title">The Red Mountain Devil’s den</div>
			A rocky cleft cuts into the bluff, presenting a hundred-foot drop
			onto seaweed-covered rocks and tide pools. Several ledges, each
			connected by rickety-looking rope bridges, lead down into the cleft
			to the rocky beach below. What appears to be a large nest of
			driftwood, grass, bits of cloth, and perhaps bones seems to be wedged
			against the easternmost extent of the cleft.
		</div>

		<p>
			The path that goes down the ravine passes by several rock caves. At
			one point, Jack P is snared by a <a
				href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/vermin/cave-fisher/">Cave
				Fisher</a>, but an <i class="spell">Enlarge Person</i> and a few
			missiles encourage it to back the heck off.
		</p>
		<div class="ooc">Counts as defeating the fisher, but sadly the
			XP is not quite enough to get them over the magic 15000.</div>
		<p>They find the den of the Red Mountain Devil. There is fat lewt.
		</p>
		<p>They follow the path all the way down to the cove, but see that
			it appears to continue underwater. They also spot what is most
			definitely a shark. They have a blinding flash of insight: if they
			perform the tide stone ritual and lower the level of water in the
			cove, they might be able to follow the path and maybe even loot that
			sunken wreck!</p>
		<div class="ooc">You know, I should have let them destroy the
			tide stones and then figure out what to do. A DM should say "yes".
			Anyway.</div>
		<p>The ritual calls for:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The blood of a thinking creature</li>
			<li>The kiss of a serpent's tongue</li>
			<li>Waters brought from the sea</li>
			<li>In a vessel of purest metal</li>
			<li>The Lord's Sacred Name</li>
		</ol>

		<p>
			Blood of a thinking creature is easy. A serpent is likewise easy - <i
				class="spell">Summon Nature's Ally</i> will do the trick. Plenty of
			sea around here. But a vessel of purest metal and the sacred name are
			tricker. The party opt to return to port Jenivere for those two.
		</p>
		<p>For the vessel, Kraig heads to the Aspis traders and offers
			5000gp for a nice golden punchbowl. The trader is very, very keen to
			accept, but the other characters quickly slap Kraig down before he
			shakes on it. He spots a nice silver decanter, and offers "whatever
			the trader wants" for it, and so the trader quickly suggests 5kgp
			would be a fair price for this, too. Eventually he pays 500gp, which
			is way, way too much. Albeit it is a rather nice bit of silverware.
			But whatever: they have their vessel.</p>
		<p>The Lord's Sacred Name is trickier. They recall seeing it in
			the caves of the mother, but don't have a record of it. There's some
			DM confusion as Nix proposes an infiltration of the caves, and the DM
			is like "why?". Eventually, Jack P's player, who takes detailed notes
			every game, finds the name Ydersius in his notes. So they are set.</p>

		<div class="gameday">Day 102</div>
		<p>
			They return to the tide stone. They perform the ritual. They decide
			that "kiss of a serpent's tongue" means mixing the blood with some
			venom, and the DM decides that no-one could possibly be expected to
			work out that that bit means getting a snake to lick the rune on the
			4 tide stones. There is an almighty lightning stroke exactly like the
			one on day 60, and the water in the cove drains. Revealed is the
			wreck of the <cite class="ship">Salty Strumpet</cite>, and far across
			the cove under the waterline a set of big double doors with snake
			carvings all over them, leading into the depths of the mountain.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is one in the afternoon, day 102 since the <cite class="ship">Jenivere</cite>
			was wrecked on Smuggler's Shiv.
		</p>
		<div class="ooc">
			Dun Dun Duuuun! Bring your whip and fedora, peoples. And a wand of <i
				class="spell">Fireball</i>, if you have one. Which you don't. It's
			time to unravel the mystery of Smuggler's Shiv.
