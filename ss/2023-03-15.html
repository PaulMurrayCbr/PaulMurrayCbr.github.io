		<h3>Game 20</h3>
		<div class="ooc">We have had three games and a spoon shortage
			over the past three weeks. We have also completed part 1, so there’s
			that. All the mysteries of Smuggler’s Shiv are resolved. I shall just
			list what happened.</div>

		<div class="imgright">
			<img src="006-055 PZO9037 Shiv-47.png" width="100%">
			<p style="text-align: center;">Ekubus the Water Mephit</p>
		</div>

		<p>The party crossed the slippery rocks exposed by the tide stone
			ritual and investigated the ship. The ship proved to be inhabited by
			a crazed but not hostile water mephit, who was convinced he was
			captain of the drowned wreck. Kraig proceeded to persuade him that
			no, actually he was the captain. Look at all his captains hats!
			Eventually the mephit was convinced.</p>
		<p>Meanwhile, Widmanstaten investigated the hold, finding a spear
			urchin and a Rope of Climbing.</p>

		<div class="boxtext">
			<div class="title">Temple Doors</div>
			Two stone doors stand open at the base of this cliff above a curling
			spur of rock. Seaweed covers the doors, hanging down in thick green
			and black sheets, just obscuring some sort of carvings on their
			surface.
		</div>
		<p>Eventually they, with Ekubus in tow, followed more of the
			slippery, slippery rocks to the open double doors leading up into the
			mountain.</p>

		<div class="boxtext">
			<div class="title">Sanctum</div>
			Over a dozen stone pillars support this cavernous chamber’s
			sixty-foot-high vaulted ceiling. To the north, four empty alcoves sit
			in the walls, their edges carved to resemble yawning, fanged mouths.
			To the south, a pair of bronze doors that seem to drip with blood sit
			under a stone bridge that passes through the upper portion of the
			room from east to west forty feet above. The walls are decorated with
			unsettling carvings of bats, human sacrifice, and the walking dead.
			The dismembered, skeletal bodies of three humans lie scattered on the
			floor of this chamber.
		</div>

		<div class="imgright">
			<img src="006-055 PZO9037 Shiv-49.png" width="100%">
			<p style="text-align: center;">Serpentfolk Skeleton</p>
		</div>
		<p>Travelling up the stairs, they came to a large, high chamber
			with doors at the far end and 60’ above them a walkway across. On the
			walkway, three skeletons who commenced to loose javelins. Nix and
			Keigh climed the walls up to the walkway with monk skill and ninja
			tiger claw thingies. Meanwhile, the rest of the party took some hits
			and fired with missiles and spells.</p>
		<p>Once up on the walkway, Keigh and Nix engaged the skeletons in
			melee. Odd-looking skeletons, with snake heads rather than human.
			Keigh was badly hurt and needed to jump down for healing. But, his
			monk slow fall made that not a problem.</p>
		<p>Eventually, the remaining skeletons ran out of javelins and
			jumped down, and the fight was soon over.</p>
		<p>In the corners of the chamber was a lever in one alcove and a
			trapdoor in the floor of another. The party opted not to fool with
			either. Up on the walkway, there was a long passage to the left and a
			shorter passageway opening out into a room on the right. The less
			climb-capable party members went for the doors at the opposite end of
			the chamber. This led to a passage going left and right, with step
			stairs going up. They all decided to head up to the right, to the
			room.</p>

		<div class="boxtext">
			<div class="title">Scriptorium</div>
			Bits of bone and fragments of wood lie scattered through this room.
			The walls are carved with hundreds, perhaps thousands, of strange
			runes interspersed with the periodic image of a stylized rune that
			looks like a fanged skull.
			<div class="title">Priest Cells</div>
			Bare alcoves line the walls of this hallway, each containing a
			scattering of wood and cloth fragments. A larger empty chamber lies
			ahead.
		</div>

		<p>The room proved to be an old scriptorium, the walls inscribed
			with writings explicating a number of important plot points.</p>
		<p>But shortly after entering the room, four skeletons emerged
			from a corridor coming off the room. These were swiftly bottlenecked
			and dealt with one by one. As this was going on, four more emerged
			from the other corridor, which no-one had blocked. However, these
			were regular skels and not a huge threat. The corridors led to what
			might once have been monk cells and a common room.</p>
		<p>Eventually, Jack P decoded the writings on the wall. And,
			seeing as the room was defensible, they opted to camp.</p>

		<p>Four key bits of information can be gleaned from the carvings.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>This chamber was once a scriptorium where books and scrolls
				sacred to the worship of Zura were transcribed and illuminated.</li>
			<li>This temple was built over an even more ancient temple— one
				that was dedicated to a deity referred to only as the “Beheaded
				One,” an entity that was apparently an enemy to the ancient Zura
				cultists.</li>
			<li>Several prayers seem to indicate that the ancients made use
				of undead slaves created from both “humans culled from the
				unbelievers and slaves of the Beheaded One.”</li>
			<li>As much hatred as the Zura cultists had for the “slaves of
				the Beheaded One,” they also seemed to despise their own
				kind—especially those they called the “misbegotten of Saventh-Yhi.”
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Game 21</h3>

		<p>After a long rest, they investigated the long corridor. It
			proved to be trapped with a pit trap, so they investigated the other
			long corridor. It too was trapped, so they disabled the trap and
			continued. Rounding the corner, they found that both long corridors
			joined up and continued. And they failed to notice the third pit
			trap. I forget who fell in, but someone did, and drew the attention
			of one of the inhabitants of the complex – a Gibbering Mouther, a
			rock-dissolving, acid-spitting, amorphous horror covered in mouths
			that, well, gibbered.</p>
		<div class="ooc">At this point there was a rules dispute
			involving monsters having grab – does the grapple check triggered by
			the grab ability count as a grapple success for purposes of the
			gibbering mouthers ability damage?</div>

		<div class="boxtext">
			<div class="title">Cleansing Shrine</div>
			An oval pool of what looks like softly rippling blood sits at the
			center of this octagonal room, filling the air with a metallic tang.
			Four round pillars support a ceiling decorated with crisscrossed
			supports and grooves, while ten two-foot-wide circular holes decorate
			the walls at chest level.
		</div>
		<p>Beyond the pit, a door led to a room with a pool of blood. Few
			seconds after entering, heavy brass panels slid down in front of the
			doors, trapping the party in the room. And a swinging pendulum
			descended from the ceiling. It managed to crit Jack P, doing 15
			points of Dex damage.</p>
		<div class="ooc">There were more rules disputes involving the
			feasibility of jumping onto a huge swinging brass pendulum blade
			trap. Meanwhile, peeps were unhappy about this deadly trap room with
			no way out. I ought to have suggested - as DM with player new to the
			system - some options, but the cutlery drawer had ran empty.</div>
		<p>Someone found the button to disable the trap, and the brass
			panels over the doors slid back.</p>

		<h3>Game 22</h3>

		<div class="ooc">This week I expected a short game, but it
			turned out that there was still quite a bit to explore.</div>

		<div class="boxtext">
			<div class="title">Temple of Blood</div>
			Judging from this cathedral-like chamber’s decor, this area must have
			once been a significant temple dedicated to some vile god. To the
			west, a few steps lead up to a shrine presided over by a
			ten-foot-high statue of a beautiful, fanged woman, save that instead
			of arms she possesses two upraised bat-like wings and instead of feet
			her legs end in talons. She looms over a glistening altar of
			blood-red stone that seems to weep blood into a trough below; this
			trough of blood runs the length of the room before disappearing to
			the east through a set of bronze bars in front of a wide opening in
			the wall that drops away into darkness. Stone pillars support the
			roof 25 feet above and three large alcoves, one to the south and two
			to the north, contain complex wall carvings. The entire chamber feels
			unnaturally cold, and now and then strange disembodied whispers
			slither through the air.
		</div>
		<div class="imgright">
			<img src="006-055 PZO9037 Shiv-53.png" width="100%">
			<p style="text-align: center;">Yazroth, aka Iaena, Serpentfolk
				Priestess</p>
		</div>

		<p>This was definitely the boss fight room, so both the party and
			the boss buffed and entered. Ieana the Varisian scholar was present,
			now revealed to be a serpentfolk priestess of Ydersius. She had
			summoned 7 skeletons to block the door and had cast Blur and Mirror
			Image. A Stone Call and a channel positive energy from the druid and
			the cleric dealt with the skeletons, but Stone Call leaved difficult
			terrain and Ieana had summoned some vipers.</p>
		<p>Nevertheless, the melee guys managed to get up onto the altar
			platform, crossing the slippery, slippery blood-soaked stones, they
			and the archers whittled down the mirror images, and eventually
			brought her down.</p>
		<p>Well.</p>
		<p>Lots to see and do in this chapel. At one end, a statue of
			Zura, an altar weeping blood, a dead Ieana, and a 2ft wide hole in
			the ceiling. At the other, a brass grating leading on to a natural
			cavern. And in the room itself, plenty of ancient writings for Jack P
			to investigate.</p>


		<p>The carvings, all written in Azlanti, tell the history of this
			particular Zura cult in three stages.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The southern carving tells of the cult’s genesis in the city
				of Saventh-Yhi in the jungle, but is frustratingly vague when it
				comes to exact details on the legendary city apart from confirming
				that it was built by Azlanti—this section ends with the cult’s exile
				from Saventh-Yhi and how they made a dangerous overland journey that
				ended on the shores of a remote island far from their homeland.</li>
			<li>The northwestern carving takes up the story at this point,
				detailing the cult’s exploration of this island (identifiable as
				Smuggler’s Shiv), their discovery and defeat of a large group of
				serpentfolk who had gone into hiding the defeat of their kind many
				years before at Saventh-Yhi, and the creation of this temple.</li>
			<li>The northeastern carving plots the cult’s future plans,
				focusing on how they had hoped to earn the gift of vampirism from
				Zura by undertaking extensive and vile rituals, and once this gift
				was theirs, how they planned on making the journey back to
				Saventh-Yhi to awaken that city with Zura’s blessing.</li>
		</ol>


		<p>The statue got tipped over onto the altar. Nothing much
			happened except the altar got chipped. They then noticed that this
			altar wept blood, so they decided to destroy it. When they did, a
			great wave of … something, some kind of force came out of it, and
			after they felt an odd sense of oppression being lifted.</p>
		<p>In respect of the hole in the ceiling, they sent their rope of
			climbing up – which apparently you can do – and then the halfling
			cavalier. The hole led to the head priest’s private room (not
			entirely sure, if only the head priest can get there, who empties the
			bucket, but whatever), which Ieana had been using as a campsite.
			There was nothing interesting in her gear, but there was a panel in
			the wall which Ieana had not touched. But Kraig touched it, yes
			indeed he did, and now he has some rather nasty permanent ability
			drain that a Restoration won’t fix, bwahahaha!</p>
		<p>However, there was loot.</p>

		<div class="boxtext">
			<div class="title">Dark Lake</div>
			The walls of this long, high-ceilinged cavern seem almost to be
			ancient worked stone decorated with serpentine carvings or other
			eerie shapes. Above, the ceiling is a forest of slowly dripping
			stalactites, while below the floor is taken up by a rippling pool of
			dark water.
		</div>
		<p>So, to the grating. Widmanstaaten made short work of this.
			Beyond was a large natural cavern, and water 60’ below. Jack P opted
			to go down the rope of climbing and swim, all alone, in the cool,
			deep, dark water. But, nothing killed him. He eventually found a
			floor – the end of the cavern rose up and out of the water. There was
			a 2-foot wide tunnel. There were oddly melted rocks. He opted, with
			his party miles away and no idea what was going on, to go down the
			tunnel alone. Further and further he went, eventually coming to an
			odd 15’ by 10’ room with a high, metal ceiling with a seam down the
			middle. After a moment, he realized he was at the base of a pit trap,
			and those melted rocks had been melted by the gibbering mouther, and
			that he was damn, damn lucky that the thing was already dead.</p>
		<p>And, that was that. They emerged from the complex – swimming
			the now-submerged entrance. There was cutscene:</p>

		<div class="dream">

			<p>In another place where time moves differently, two women
				fight. One bat-winged, fanged, demonic, her lips dripping with
				blood; the other in full pirate regalia with a captain's hat and a
				rapier. They fight in a dark cave deep underground / in a
				bloodstained, blasphemous cathederal / on the rolling deck of a ship
				under full sail / in a seedy dockside bar. They contend with spell
				and divine will, reality buckling and bending under the strain /
				they fight with rapiers, a blinding, impossible display of skill /
				they engage in a hair-pulling catfight, complete with biting and
				gouging. It depends on your point of view.</p>
			<p>The vampire hisses and claws; the pirate yells "Give over,
				bitch! These hearties are mine!" They have been fighting for
				centuries, but now the bat-winged woman hesitates and stumbles, now
				the vampire looks desperately from side to side, now the goddess
				Zura cries "No!", and the pirate with a cry of "Yarr!" boots her off
				the deck and into the drink.</p>
			<p>After a moment, from the sea a third woman rises - her giant
				form made of blue green seawater, her face mutable, protean, not
				exactly human. The pirate regards her with respect, perhaps a little
				fear. But she is proud, and strikes a swashbuckling pose. "Ye also,
				Gozreh. Give over! Release me crew!"</p>
			<p>"Gladly", the blue woman replies, “They are safe, if a little
				worse for wear. The souls of mortals are not my concern, but I have
				forbidden them to Zura. Take them, Besmara, and fair weather to you
				- for a little while."</p>
			<p>All around the shores of Smugglers Shiv, the surf boils and
				gives up the spirits of the dead. Some few immediately ascend to the
				sky, some descend to the depths, but most swim in the surf, calling
				for help. Ghostly ships appear, heaving ghostly cargo nets into the
				water; ghostly jolly-boats haul men out of the drink and to safety.
				When every soul is accounted for, the ships depart - raising sail
				and fading away.</p>
			<p>The party emerge from the temple of Zura, and climb the path
				to the top of the bluff. A cool sea breeze blows, giving welcome
				relief from the heat and humidity. Above Smuggler's Shiv, a few
				high, puffy clouds scud across an untroubled sky of flawless blue.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="ooc">
			<p>And so, the end. The island was mapped, the sailors freed, the
				nightvoice found, and people got loot. However, a variety of people
				seem to be very, very interested in the long lost city of
				Saventh-Yhi. And with Ieana’s notes, perhaps it might be re-found.</p>
			<p>Oh, and Gozreh had a private word with Volka. Something about
				an upcoming long journey, and a small gift.</p>
