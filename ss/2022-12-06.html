		<h2>Part 1: Souls for Smuggler's Shiv</h2>
		<h3>Game 11</h3>

		<p class="ooc">I didn't write up game last week. Forget what
			dinner was. Dinner this week was burritos. Mince, beans, onion,
			packet burrito mix. Lettuce.</p>

		<div class="gameday">Day 51</div>

		<p>The remainder of day 51 is spent exploring the camp and
			distributing loot, and looking up rulebooks to work out what the loot
			does.</p>

		<p class="ooc">I printed out the items, one line per, and cut the
			sheet up to make it easy to distribute. I very much prefer handing
			out tokens for items, rather than "Who got the potion of Enlarge
			Person?". As promised, I included a little extra by way of apology
			for the excessively buffed cannibals.</p>

		<p>Our heroes decide to check out what is in the cave below the
			hatch in the main square. There's a rope leading down.</p>

			<div class="title">v19. entrance cavern</div>
			The uneven floor of this ten-foot-high cave is stained with blood and
			scattered with pieces of wood, fallen leaves, broken weapons, and in
			places, bits of bone. A hole in the ceiling leads out to the surface.
		</div>
		<p>They descend 20' into a small cave. Beneath the entrance hole
			lie two cannibals. Unknown to them, the four remaining cannibals
			fought over the women, and these two were the losers.</p>
		<p>To the east, there is a passage going down.</p>

		<div class="boxtext">
			<div class="title">v20. cavern of unbirth</div>
			The smell of decay is thick in the air of this wide but low-
			ceilinged cavern. To one side, the ceiling drops down to little more
			than three feet in height over a region strewn with bones and bits of
			old flesh, while to the other, the ceiling bulges upward in a dome
			shape—six circular, pod-like alcoves line the walls of the cave at
			this side.
		</div>

		<div class="imgright">
			<img src="006-055 PZO9037 Shiv-38.png" width="100%"> Festrogs
			is what happens when the ghoul transformation goes wrong.
		</div>

		<p>They enter the Cavern of Unbirth, which is guarded by two
			horribly altered ghouls - festrogs. They attack. After a fight, the
			party examine the birthing pods. One of them has a note written in
			blood on a scrap of leather armour. It contains a number of important
			plot points.</p>

		<div class="dream">I am Captain Alizandru Kovack, betrayer of my
			crew and destroyer of the good ship Jenivere. Hell would be a welcome
			escape from what hideous unlife looms before me, but it is no less a
			punishment than I deserve. That I was enslaved mind and body to a
			serpentine demon who wore a Varisian’s skin does not pardon me. It is
			my weakness that led the Jenivere, her crew, and her passengers to
			their doom. That Ieana has abandoned me here is nothing more than the
			fate I deserve. I do not beg forgiveness, but I despair that she
			lives still, and that she seeks something dire on this forsaken
			isle—she seemed particularly interested in Red Mountain. If you read
			this and you be a kind soul, seek out what I have become and destroy
			me, and then seek out Ieana and slay her as well. And to those whose
			lives I have helped destroy, I can only apologize from this, my dark
			cradle and darker grave.</div>
		<p>There is an exit to the southeast.</p>

		<div class="boxtext">
			<div class="title">v21. the throat</div>
			A dark pool of water lies in the center of this silo-shaped cavern. A
			five-foot-wide ledge of stone winds down to the pool below, passing
			several cave entrances along the way.
		</div>

		<p>The stone ledge passes five exits, including the one they have
			just emerged from. They go down and into the first.</p>

		<div class="boxtext">
			<div class="title">v22. temple</div>
			This long chamber evokes the feel of an ancient, hideous cathedral.
			The walls are carved with images of serpents walking upright like
			humans, snakes coiling around and eating hapless women and children,
			and stranger scenes. Four stone pillars carved like coiling snakes
			support the vaulted ceiling 30 feet above. Four small cells blocked
			by rusted bars sit in the walls to the east and west. To the north,
			an immense carving of a snake’s head looms, an ash-caked door
			clenched in its jaws, while to the south rises a horrific mound of
			bones and partially decayed bodies in an eight-foot-tall heap
			arranged almost as if to evoke the imagery of a coiled snake made of
			corpses.
		</div>
		<p>Well! Well, well, well! Ancient ruins! Jack P's archaeologist's
			senses tingle, but there's no time for that. On the pile of bones in
			the temple are a couple more ghouls. They attack. One of them seems
			particularly interested in (one of) Snid's Captain's Hats, and
			focuses on him. They fight. The ghoul who was interested in Snid's
			hat is definitely captain Kovack, hopefully at rest now.</p>
		<p>They search the temple thoroughly. This search ought to have
			turned up a thing, but I missed it on the night, so that didn't
			happen. Sorry. Finding nothing, they turn thier attention to the door
			to the north, clenched in the serpent's jaws.</p>

		<div class="boxtext">
			<div class="title">v23. inner sanctum</div>
			A low stone altar, its sides carved like coiling snakes and its top
			carved to resemble a yawning viper’s maw, sits in the center of this
			room. The walls of the chamber are carved with images of
			anthropomorphic serpents using strange, pointed megaliths of stone to
			work great feats of magic—transforming an army of humans into
			zombies, calling down flaming bolts of lightning from the stars, or
			parting the waters of the sea to dash human ships upon the exposed
			rocks of the seabed below. This final image seems to have been
			recently cleaned of dust, and several lines of text have been made
			more legible via the application of inks and perhaps blood.
		</div>

		<p>
			Jack P determines that this final image was cleaned carefully with a
			brush. Someone definitely knew what they were doing. He casts <cite
				class="spell">Comprehend Languages</cite> and reads the text:
		</p>
		<div class="dream" style="font-family: sscorners;">To Command
			the Very Tides to Rise Up and Eschew What Lies Below: Empower the
			Four Sentinel Runes with the Blood of a Thinking Creature Tempered by
			the Kiss of a Serpent’s Tongue. Anoint the Tide Stone with Waters
			Brought from the Sea in a Vessel of Purest Metal. Invoke the Lord’s
			Sacred Name to Wrap His Coils around the Sea Itself that He Might Lay
			Bare What Lies Below and Cast Down Your Enemies on the Waves above.</div>

		<div class="ooc">We were a player down, and the player who
			played Pezcock the other week was not available. So, a party of four.
		</div>
		<p>The party return to the vertical cavern with the ledge, and
			take the next exit.</p>
		<div class="boxtext">
			<div class="title">v24. cave scrawlings</div>
			Faint carvings are just visible on the eastern wall of this cavern.

		<p>
			Jack P still has his <cite class="spell">Comprehend Languages</cite>
			running, so after a little work easily reads the scrawlings.
		</p>
		<div class="dream" style="font-family: sscorners;">All Glory to

		<p>There is an exit to the west, which they opt to take.</p>

		<div class="boxtext">
			<div class="title">v25. ghoulish cavern</div>
			Bones lie strewn about the floor of this cavern. The grisly remains
			appear to have been gnawed upon so that they are cracked and jagged.
		</div>
		<p>A lone ghoul sitting on the bones sees them, lets out a shriek,
			and scampers off through a passage to the northwest. The party
			discuss options, and retreat to the "cave scrawlings" cave to take up
			positions for combat.</p>
		<p class="ooc">This next bit was just so awesome &hellip;</p>
		<div class="imgright">
			<img src="006-055 PZO9037 Shiv-43.png" width="100%">Nylithati,
			aka Mother Thrunefang.
		</div>
		<p>But instead of combat, someone is calling for parley. An old,
			old, voice. A dead-for-a-long-time voice. It is mother thrunefang
			herself, finally.</p>
		<p>"Wait! Wait!", she calls. "Please understand. We arrived here
			over a century ago, to colonize Sargava in the name of house Thrune.
			Our task was to build the lighthouse above, but even then a curse lay
			on this island &hellip;"</p>
		<p>
			Unknown to the party, Nylithati had cast <cite class="spell">Enthrall</cite>,
			and each one of them had failed their will save.
		</p>
		<p>As she related the story of the failed attempt to build the
			lighthouse and colonise the island, her remaining four ghouls
			unthreateningly entered the room, and took places next to each of the
			four party members.</p>
		<p>Then she channeled negative energy to kick things off, and it
			was on.</p>
		<p>Ghouls bite and claw, each hit carrying ghoul paralysis, and
			are bad news if they get the drop on you. Within moments, the
			already-injured party were paralysed or dying. Only Nix escaped, by
			turning invisible and fleeing. She stealthily observed what happened
			next.</p>
		<p class="ooc">Booyah! TPK! TPK! G D TPK! Uuh! Imma talkin' double
			Uuh! The despair around the table was real.</p>
		<p>
			You see, Mother Thrunefang didn't want these people <em>dead</em>.
			Her ghouls bound their wounds, and carried and dragged them to the
			Cavern of Unbirth, and placed each - heavily bound - in a pod.
			Nylithati then carefully infected each one with ghoul fever - no
			save. And then she left a ghoul to guard them, to wait for their
			transformation.
		</p>
		<p>
			But the party travel with 5 other survivors of the wreck of the <cite>Jenevere</cite>.
			Nix ascended the rope, or perhaps ninja-climed out of the cavern, and
			went to alert them.
		</p>
		<p class="ooc">At this point, I printed off the serpents skull
			NPCs and the players picked who they wanted to play. Ayeris the
			fighter was not available, as she had been a captive of the cannibals
			for weeks and has taken a lot of con damage.</p>
		<p>Nix, Sasha, Jask, and Ishirou descended into the caves and made
			their way to the cavern of unbirth. Nix and Ishirou quickly dealt
			with the ghoul, for which the party will not be getting XP, and
			hoisted the party out.</p>

				<p class="ooc">OK, guys, it's 11, and I have started drinking.
			This is going to get compressed.</p>
		<p>Everyone decides to occupy the lighthouse, which can be
			fortified. Snid wedges the doors. At midnight, Nylithati and her
			three remaining ghouls attack.</p>
		<p>
			Nylithati does what anyone who owns some undead will do. She tells
			them to batter down the door, which they commence to do. It's going
			to take a while. The party, up on the parapet of the lighthouse, fire
			arrows. Nylithati deals with it by casting <cite class="spell">Darkness</cite>.
		</p>
		<p>At this point, Nix is preparing fire arrows, which I think Jack
			P fires at where the door is. One of the ghouls is set alight, but
			Nylithati doesn't know it. Meanwhile, Snid heads around to the other
			barrel of pitch in the storeroom across the courtyard and begins
			dipping thatching in the pitch, lighting it, and throwing that into
			the mix.</p>
		<p>
			After a bit, instead of two slams on the door each round, there's
			only one slam. Nylithati is like "WTF?" and dispels the <cite
				class="spell">Darkness</cite>, seeing the fire everywhere. So, she
			does what anyone who owns undead will do, and tells one of the ghouls
			to pick up some of the burning thatch and apply it to the wooden
			door, and then takes the other ghoul to shelter in one of the other
			buildings.
		</p>
		<p>Well, the ghoul that applied the fire rolls badly and takes
			fatal damage. Mother thrunefang is left with one thrall. Snid climbs
			the roof of then outbuilding and empties half the barrel of pitch on
			each of the two doors, and applies fire. The roof, although palmleaf
			thatch, will not catch because it is sodden from the daily rain.</p>
		<p>Mother Thrunefang exits the building the back way, up to the
			observation tower, and dives into the water. She's a ghoul and
			doesn't need to breathe. She's gone. Which is a bit of a pity because
			she had some really, really nice loot for a cleric. Oh well.</p>
		<p>The rest of the night is uneventful. Tomorrow morning, it will
			be day 53, and Snid, Jack, and Kraig will be dealing with ghoul
			fever.</p>
