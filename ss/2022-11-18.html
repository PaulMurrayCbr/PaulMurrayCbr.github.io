		<h2>Part 1: Souls for Smuggler's Shiv</h2>
		<h3>Game 9</h3>

		<div class="ooc">
			<p>Diner was - I think - chicken caccitore? Slow cooked chicken,
				ton of tomato, olives, veg.</p>
			<p>We were a party member down. Jack, this time. Not sure what
				the player was up to - probably getting laid or some nonsense like
				that.</p>
			<p>Full house! Plus an extra. One of our dear friends has been
				giving work way, way too much of his precious time, but was
				available this week. I had him play Pezcock for the cannibal camp
				raid. Perhaps he will be able to play more regularly.</p>
			<p>I way overpowered the encounter as a result of an oversight.
				The party had already killed two groups of six cannibals without
				much difficulty and were now level 3. I decided to make three of the
				cannibals level 2 rather than level 1 barbarians, and split them
				into three groups, each led by a level 2 miniboss.</p>
			<p>
				I entered the cannibal's stats into HeroLab because I was leveling
				up three of them and wanted the modified stats printed out. However,
				I entered the statblock from the module and then applied rage. The
				problem being that the statblock in the book already includes rage.
				Consequently, the cannibals had a +8 to Str and Con instead of the
				proper +4. Ouch. I <em>thought</em> +6 to hit, 1d6+6 damage was way
				too much for a CR 1/2 monster.
			</p>
			<p>I shall redress this by paying the DM's price. These guys have
				plenty of XP - ahead of the module progression - but what they don't
				have is loot.</p>

		<div class="gameday">Day 50</div>

		<p>Our heroes have a big, big day.</p>
		<p>Pezcock joins the party for the assault on the cannibals. It's
			on! Our stealth expert - I think Nix, or maybe it was Pezcock -
			scouts out the cannibal camp. They inhabit the encampment built by
			the colonists from the house of Thrune, who were attempting to
			colonise Sargavia many decades ago. There is a runined lighthouse and
			some outbuildings, surrounded by an impenetrable wall of vines woven
			through the trees - thick and decades old.</p>

		<p>While hanging out near the path, arguing about what to do
			next, a group of cannibals comes along. Game on!</p>
		<p>The fight is over reasonably quickly, and the party retreat
			into the jungle. But, well:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>They are only a mile or two down the main road from the
				cannibal camp. The dudes know this area well.</li>
			<li>The cannibals know they are on the island.</li>
			<li>One of the group went back to tell the village, because meh.</li>
			<li>The cannibals actively hunt down shipwreck survivors for
				food. They are ferocious cannibals, FFS.</li>
		</ol>
		<div class="imgright">
			<img src="006-055 PZO9037 Shiv-30.png" width="100%">
		</div>
		<p>So, just about all the cannibals left on the island attack. Two
			groups, and Klorak The Red.</p>
		<div class="ooc">
			<p>I guess I need to wax philosophical about railroading for a
				minute.</p>
			<p>Sometimes, it's a DM's job to kick the adventure forward.
				There is, after all, a story to be told.</p>
			<p>Sometimes, it's a DM's job to poke people into playing their
				characters as heroes, rather than "Imma skiered of cannibals!".</p>
			<p>
				And sometimes, you got six people around a table, each of them
				saying to the other five, "I dunno, what do <em>you</em> think we
				should do?</em>".
			</p>
			<p>It's cannibal isle. There are cannibals. Hungry cannibals. The
				hungry, crazed, devil-worshipping cannibals attacked. I was
				momentarily bummed not to be doing the big fight on the map I had
				set up, but meh. I pulled out a Paizo™ flip-mat™ with some
				appropriate terrain, and it was all good.</p>

		<p>The two groups pincer the party. Most of the party attacks the
			group with Klorak the Red, leaving Pezcock and Snid to deal with the
			other. Owing to my issue with stats, it was pretty brutal. Much
			happened:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Volka: Party healer dealing with healer's angst - everyone
				is scattered, everyone is hurt, and you can't heal 'em all.</li>
			<li>Jack: working to give Nix a flank. Being reduced to zero
				about three times.</li>
			<li>Nix: got taken down by a crit early on, which was a real
				problem for the party as Nix is the primary damage-dealer.</li>
			<li>Kraig: challenged Klorak the Red. Traditional tank action.</li>
			<li>Snid and Pezcock: dealing with half the cannibals by
				themselves. Pezcock got knocked out, I think Snid climbed a tree to
				escape.</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="ooc">We are using crit cards, and I'm thinking that they
			are way too harsh to be used by mooks against the party. A party,
			over time, does a lot of fighting and necessarily gets hit and
			critted. The one that hit Nix was "you get permanently blinded" -
			WTF?!? I had Nix blinded by blood from a slash until she got some
			healing.</p>
		<p>
			Our cleric got to use their big gun: <cite>Call Lightning</cite>. (I
			have made this a domain spell, because it is an obvious pick for a
			cleric of Gozreh.) The weather over <cite>Smuggler's Shiv</cite> is
			always hot and cloudy and unsettled - there are always thunderheads
			in the sky, there's odd flashes of cloud lightning throughout the
			day. Volka dropped three 3d10 lightning strikes, each of them killing
			a cannibal instantly. It mattered.
		</p>
		<p>After four rounds, the bulk of the cannibals lost their puff
			and came out of rage (but were still at +2 owing to my mix-up). They
			fight hard, but are easy to hit and don't have a lot of hp. Klorak
			goes down. The leaders go down. The mooks get mopped up. And everyone
			is left alive - even Pezcock.</p>
		<p>They are badly, badly hurt. But victorious. And Kraig has
			claimed Klorak's shiny sword for his own. It's magic! They retreat
			back to their own camp. If there are cannibals left alive, they want
			to be healed up before dealing with them. But the lighhouse they have
			spent nearly two months trying to find is just a mile or so down the
			track.</p>
		<p>
			Tomorrow, it will be day 51 marooned on <cite>Smuggler's Shiv</cite>.

		<p class="ooc">Interestingly, the players seem to have completely
			forgotten about the thingy. But they'll remember soon. Oh yes,
			indeedy they will.</p>
