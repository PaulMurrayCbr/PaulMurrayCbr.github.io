		<h2>Part 1: Souls for Smuggler's Shiv</h2>
		<h3>Game 6</h3>

		<div class="ooc">
			<p>Dinner was a gluten-free layer thingy in a baking pan - potato
				slices, veg, chicken, and a fair bit of cheese. Chicken parboiled
				(if that's the word) with herbs, then sliced up, bones back in the
				pot and boiled to make stock. The result could have used a bit more
				herbs, and maybe some cream sauce or some of the chicken fat that
				got left behind in the stock, and the potato is a tiny bit crunchy,
				but overall there was plenty of it and that's the main thing. It's
				dinner for me for a few days.</p>
			<p>In-game, we were down a player this week, missing the party
				cleric, so people were a bit more cautious.</p>

			The survivors of the <cite>Jenivere</cite> investigate the shores of
			the south side of the inner cove of the island. In particular, they
			are interested in the large orange thing they spotted from the bluffs
			on the north. The orange thing proves to be another giant grab, but
			this one is gargantuan - the size of a house. After a little
			discussion they decide to leave it be and explore further into the
			interior of the island.
		</p>

		<p>Travelling along paths is far quicker, but they note that the
			path southwards into the interior follows a narrow gully between two
			cliffs - an ideal spot for an ambush. They opt instead to climb the
			cliffs and explore the east. The upland is cut by another one of the
			island's fast, deep rivers, fed by the daily rain. Following along
			its shore, on day 33 a pod of three shocker lizards emerge from the
			water.</p>
		<p>The fight is fierce. But Snid and Nix both score critical hits,
			Nix's hit being memorably gory and exhibiting max overkill, the
			lizard's innards (Hey! I'm a poet and don't knowet!) splattering
			across the battlefield.</p>
		<div class="ooc">We are using the Paizo critical hit cards.
			Jeremy pulled "disembowel" out of the deck.</div>
		<p>They spot something on the other side of the river, and decide
			to set up one of Snid's log bridges, which will take a day.</p>

		<p>Unknown to the party, they were completely right about the
			gully being an ambush site. Atop the cliffs is one of the island's
			cannibals - a descendant of the survivors of the House of Thrune's
			ill-fated attempt to colonise Sargava. He is well hidden, and the
			party do not spot him. But he spots them, and goes to alert his tribe
			that there are strangers on the island.</p>
		<p>For the first time, the party encounter the island's human
			inhabitants. The cannibals have little subtlety, and simply charge in
			a mass.</p>
		<div class="ooc">Pity there's no AoE in the party. Volka might
			have something, but the player was out for the night.</div>
		<p>
			The party fight and are victorious. They keep one cannibal alive. He
			speaks a barely-recognisable pidgin, but Jack Profile suddenly
			remembers that he is a spellcaster with <i class="sp">Charm
				Person</i> and <i class="sp">Comprehend Languages</i>.
		</p>
		<div class="ooc">
			<p>On the one hand - grr, John, read your character sheet ffs.
				But on the other hand - he can't. The character sheets are here at
				my place. I need to host them on this website and get them into
				HeroLab online. Speaking of which, have my players made accounts and
				joined my campaign yet? &hellip; (Sigh) of course not. And anyway,
				everyone is new at Pathfinder, and I don't think John has played a
				caster yet in any campaign. I have done it many times, and am in the
				habit of scanning my spells and scrolls for useful possibilities
				during an encounter.</p>
			<p>It was nice to see Jack Profile getting a chance to do his
				thing. The campaign so far has just been fighting through the
				jungle, so the archaeologist hasn't had much opportunity to grab the
				spotlight aside from the knowledge checks.</p>
		</div>
		<p>
			The <i class="sp">Charm Person</i> fails to have an effect, but <i
				class="sp">Comprehend Languages</i> works perfectly well, and Jack's
			<span class="sk">linguistics</span> skill is enough to make himself
			understood. But the cannibal offers little but threats that "Mother
			Thrunefang" will make them all pay. Jack manages to <span class="sk">bluff</span>
			an approximate location of the cannibal camp out of their captive -
			somewhere in the southwest.
		</p>
		<p>At this point, our shining exemplar of Lawful Good nobility,
			the cavalier Kraig, comes over all bloodthirsty and suggests feeding
			the cannibal to the house-sized giant crab. Maybe he's appalled by
			the symbols of Asmodeus scarred into the cannibal's flesh. Maybe he's
			turned off by cannibalism, which all right-thinking civilised people
			abominate and condemn.</p>
		<p class="ooc" style="font-size: 12; font-weight: lighter;">Then
			again: all civilised, right-thinking, decent folk back in the day
			used to think the same thing about being gay, just sayin'.</p>
		<p>Regardless of the rights and wrongs of it, the party concludes
			that this is a fine idea, provided that the cannibal is humanely
			dispatched before being thrown to the crab. After all, in terms of
			not having your corpse desecrated, being eaten by a crab is one step
			up from being eaten by other cannibals as part of some sort of
			bizarre Asmodean funeral rite.</p>
		<p>They travel to the beach, humanely dispatch the cannibal, and
			Kraig gallops up the beach on Horse, tosses the corpse, and makes a
			complete mess of wheeling about to come back down the beach. The crab
			stirs into motion - claws waving, feet skittering, but Jack and Snid
			both see that it is dead, and being operated by some sort of wizard
			of oz.</p>

		</div>
		<p>Who, in a few moments pokes his head into view. A strange
			birdlike humanoid. A Kenku - Pezcock by name. After a little back and
			forth, he invites the party into his home, for a light lunch of
			not-very-well-cooked sea urchin and algae.</p>
		<div class="ooc">I was going to play Pezcock as The French
			Taunter, but dropping off a dead cannibal changed things, as Pezcock
			has a beef with them.</div>
		<p>
			Pezcock asks them if they are with the other two humans - whom he
			describes and whos descriptions match The captain of the <cite>Jenivere</cite>
			and the scholar Ieana. Ieana, he reports, looked very much to be in
			charge, and might be in league with the cannibals.
		</p>
		<p>Over the course of lunch, he tells the party a thing or two
			about the island. On the peak in the southeast is a dangerous flying
			thing. It hunts the island, and is the reason Pezcock does not fly.
			There is some sort of nature spirit in the central west. Pezcock
			avoids the area out of prudence. And there is a causeway linking the
			main island to the island in the north, which is crossable except at
			high tide. Pezcock has never crossed it, however.</p>
		<p>Most of all, he is very cross, peeved, and upset at the
			cannibals who killed all of his friends and left him alone on the
			island. If the party intend to assault the cannibal village, he would
			be very keen to come along. In the meantime, he can guard camp, or
			hunt.</p>
		<p class="ooc">Not in the module, but it seemed like a logical
			thing to do - have him supply a quest, same as the other NPCs. I have
			in mind a suitable quest reward.</p>
		<p>The party spent the rest of the day moving camp to Pezcock's
			beach. Tomorrow, it will be Day 35 on Smuggler's Shiv.</p>
