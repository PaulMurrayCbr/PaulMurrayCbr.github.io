		<h3>Game 1</h3>
		<div class="ooc">I didn't write up game 1. Sorry. Here's a brief
			summary:</div>

		<p>Unconscious dude wakes up, turns out to be a Kitsune Ninja, for
			God's sake. Dude is now a girl, because all Kitsune are female.</p>
		<p>Monkeyboy ranger offers Ayeris food, which inexplicably annoys
			her to the point that she storms off into the jungle. She has
			probably been eaten by cannibals by now.</p>
		<div class="ooc">
			It might be a little unreasonable of Aerys to do this, but the player
			was clear that he was doing this <em>as a diplomacy check</em>, and
			if his attempt had succeeded, he'd certainly have taken the win. He
			rolled badly, and I wash my hands of it. The players now are leaving
			the diplomacy up to characters that are good at it.
		</div>
		<p>
			The players explored the wreck of the <cite>Jenevere</cite>, battling
			a Euryptid and acquiring much-needed supplies with which to set up
			camp, and also unravelling something of the story of the fateful
			night of the grounding.
		</p>
		<p>The cook is days dead - killed by what looks like an enormous
			snakebite to the neck. The first mate is dead. Rapier wounds a couple
			of days old, but it was the euryptid that finished him off.</p>
		<p>And the party recover the captain's log:</p>

		<div class="dream">
			<p>An examination of this log reveals that the Jenivere’s captain
				seemed to be suffering from some sort of madness that grew over the
				course of the ship’s final voyage. Earlier entries from previous
				voyages are precise in recording progress and events along the way,
				as are entries from the first two-thirds of this last trip. Yet as
				one reads further, the more recent the entries get, the less common
				they become — in some cases, several days are missing entries.</p>
			<p>What entries do appear are strangely short, focusing more and
				more on one of the passengers—the Varisian scholar Ieana, with whom
				the captain seems to have become obsessed. Several entries are
				nothing more than poorly written love poems to Ieana, while others
				bemoan Captain Kovack’s inability to please her or catch her
				attention.</p>
			<p>Near the end, the entries begin to take on a more ominous tone
				with the captain starting to complain that other members of the crew
				are eyeing “his Ieana.” In particular, he suspects his first mate is
				in love with her, and writes several times about how he wishes Alton
				would just “have an accident.” The final entry is perhaps the most
				disturbing, for in it the captain writes of how he’s changed course
				for Smuggler’s Shiv at Ieana’s request. He hopes that the two of
				them can make a home on the remote island, but also notes that the
				crew are growing increasingly agitated at the ship’s new course. The
				captain muses that “something may need to be done about the crew” if
				their suspicions get any worse.</p>
		</div>

		<p>
			With keys found aboard the wreck, they released Jask from his
			manacles, earning his friendship. Jask revealed to the party that he
			hoped to find the wreck of the <cite>Brine Demon</cite>, aboard which
			might be documents proving his innocence. It's a long shot, but he
			has faith in Nethys.

		<h3>Game 2</h3>
		<div class="ooc">
			<p>I have softened some of the game rules, because this is
				supposed to be fun for everyone, not just me.</p>
			<p>Story awards go to each player, they are not split. This means
				that we have gotten very quickly to level 2, which might be by
				design, as level 1 bites it big time in Pathfinder.</p>
			<p>Setting up camp is DC 12, 8 hours, with one hour off for every
				2 by which the DC 12 is exceeded. I am making this per character,
				not for the whole party. You still have to make the 12, but each
				character that rolls well can shave time off. Even characters
				without much survival can potentially help out if they roll well.</p>
			<p>Only one wandering monster per day, because wandering monsters
				get a bit grindy and obvious.</p>
			<p>Haven't softened the disease rules &hellip; but it might
				become necessary. Disease is a major, major thing - but it's meant
				to be.</p>
			<p>I have pulled the critical hit and critical fumble decks out
				of retirement.</p>
			<p>I am awarding the players 10xp per hex visited. The map is
				about 400 hexes, but the party aren't going to be going to them all.
				The 10xp is for each character, not divided among the party. When I
				ran this campaign before, the group at the time opted to get off the
				island as fast as possible, which was a bit of a shame as there's a
				lot of very cool content in the module. XP is the appropriate tool
				for steering players - 10 each is good but not great. And if they
				decide to grind the hexes for all possible XP, there's always
				malaria. Speaking of which:
			<p>
		</div>

		<p>Over the next week, the party manage to explore most of the
			"hook" at the north end of Smuggler's Shiv. Ayeris my have stormed
			off, but the remaining castaways warm to the party, mainly by keeping
			Snid well away from them and letting the cavalier and the Kitsune do
			most of the chatting.</p>

		<p>Each of them , it seems, has a story to tell.</p>
		<p>
			Gelik, like Jask, is also interested in a wreck reputed to be on
			Smuggler's Shiv. Gelik is somewhat on probation with the Pathfinders
			of Absalom. But it seems a Pathfinder ship - The <cite>Nightvoice</cite>
			- came to grief here, and he wuld be very keen to explore it.
		</p>
		<p>Shasha is very keen to make a pet of one of the flying reptiles
			of the island. It seems they are poisonous, but she is confident she
			can manage one.</p>
		<p>And Ishirou turns out to be something of a collector of old
			treasure maps. Apparently Dread Captain Quellig left booty on the
			island. Odd that he'd offer to share the loot, but it will almost
			certainly take a team of people to recover it. Quellig buried his
			treasure very, very well.</p>
		<p>The party explore, garnering XP if not loot. Vox stays at camp,
			as she is a little unwell.</p>
		<div class="ooc">We were a player down. Oh, and the character
			has disease number 61. We shall look at resolving that next session.</div>
		<p>
			Vox isn't the only one. Over the next week, Nyx (I think) is badly
			weakened by Jungle Fever, and Kraig acquires a nasty fungal infection
			known to cause blindness. The castaways spend one of the precious
			potions they found aboard the <cite>Jenivere</cite> to cure Nix, but
			Kraig manages to recover.
		</p>
		<p>
			Nevertheless, they manage to explore quite a bit, having to camp in
			the jungle for a night, as they are some miles away from thier base.
			Snid makes easy work of climbing the cliffs and has crafted a rope
			ladder with their supplies and local wood. They deal with one of the
			island's bigger snakes, and locate two nests of the Dimorphodons that
			Sasha is so keen to make a pet of. They find a wreck, but it is The <cite>Tattooed
				Lady</cite>, which is neither of the ones they are interested in. There is
			nothing aboard.
		</p>
		<p>More interestingly, they look across the bay in the interior of
			the island, a remnant of the volcano that this island once was,
			perhaps. To the west, two small islands. One of them an odd colour,
			not jungle green, but a purplish brown. And to the south on the far
			side of the bay, something orange. But they are both a good few miles
			away, and although the party stand on an escarpment providing a clear
			line of sight, they lack a telecope or anything like it.</p>
		<p>They elect to get Sasha's pet for her.</p>
		<p>One of the Dimorphodon nests has one adult, another has two.
			They opt to go for the one with one adult. A lucky sling hit from I
			forget who and didn't write it down nearly kills the thing
			mid-flight, and another hit finishes it off. Snid descends down to
			the nest and uses his ranger skills to persuade one of the chicks
			into a cage that he has crafted.</p>
		<div class="ooc">Snid is a ranger with decent animal empathy,
			and profession woodwork. Being a Vanara, he has a natural climb
			speed. Getting down to the nest and friending a chick was no problem,
			although he did suffer a bite.</div>
		<p>Back at camp, Sasha is overjoyed at her poisonous little pet.
			She offers to teach the party some of the secret skills of the Red
			Mantis, which offer they happily accept.</p>
		<p>The day of training draws to a close. The mood at camp is good.
			Some gather around the fire, one or two watch the luminescent surf
			&hellip; wait, was that a ghost in the waves? Definitely a human
			figure, beckoning the viewer to come join him in the surf. Gone, now.</p>
		<p>The night is uneventful. Dawn approaches. It is Day 9 on
			Smuggler's Shiv.</p>
