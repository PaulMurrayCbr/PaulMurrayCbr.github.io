		<p class="ooc">Dinner was chicken nibbles and costco salad. The

		<p>Our heroes, after healing up, assay the canibal camp.</p>
		<p>But first, a spot of bother in the morning. They are assailed
			by a botfly swarm. They have little way to deal with it, and Volka
			has to drop the daily: Call Lightning. It is doubly effective against
			a swarm, and disperses it in one hit. But, well, that's the daily
			gone.</p>
		<p>On to the real encounter!</p>
		<p>The village is almost empty. There is a building with 6
			skeletons, but they do not attack. The party place a barrel of pitch
			on the roof and ignite it, the flames destroying four of the
			skeltons. But, it seems they have their orders. They still do not
			attack.</p>
		<p>Presently, a pair of cannibals emerge onto the fortified
			balcony of the lighthouse and hurl javelins, and it's on.</p>

		<p>Snid climbs. Nix jumps. And Kraig goes through the door. But as
			the battle inside the lighthouse heats up, the witch Malikadna
			emerges through the building where the skeletons are, bringing with
			four skeletons.</p>
		<p class="ooc">Two guarding her more closely, because like if
			everyone was a cannibal and you had skeletons you'd be leaving them
			all off in a hut somewhere.</p>
		<p>Eventually, they all wind up in a narrow corridor at the base
			of the lighthouse. Malakidna takes cover behind a defending skeleton
			and hurls curses. They work &hellip; but without someone actually
			doing damage, debuffing the enemy does little. All of her tribe and
			all but one of her skeletons are fallen. She summons a Lemure, which
			the party have not dealt with before. It's immunity to cold stymies
			Volka's magic attacks.</p>
		<p>But all in all - too little, too late. The fight is long and
			awkward, but she falls. Our heroes are victorious yet again.</p>
		<p>Next week: lewt.</p>
