		<h2>Part 1: Souls for Smuggler's Shiv</h2>

		<div class="ooc"></div>
		<p>It's on again! I'm back behind the DM's screen, and will be
			running Serpent's Skull probably for as long as people are interested
			in playing.</p>
		<p>I'll organise this page a bit better once I have an idea of
			what is going to be in it. Maybe keep the latest game on this front
			page, archive it into a separate file. As with Age of Worms, I will
			be shamelessly ripping artwork out of the PDF, although I will also
			attempt to keep the artist's name in the image, if it's there.</p>


		The players:
		<ul>
			<li>Snid Valdeth, a vanara ranger. Stowaway.<br> Yeah, I
				let them look at the Advanced Race Guide. Might have been a mistake.
				Vanaras are monkey humanoids. I categorically forbade races with
				flying, but a natural climb speed is still pretty good.
			</li>
			<li>Kraig, a halfling cavalier. Boarded in Varisia.<br>
				Kraig's mount is a riding goat named "Horse". Stats are based on a
				Bestiary pony. We traded 'run' for a natural climb speed, and
				'docile' for the goat having just the one natural attack - a
				headbutt. A cavalier's mount has the same progression as a druid's
				animal companion.<br> Kraig is played by a new player, and as
				it happened rolled enviably well for stats, which works out nicely.
			</li>
			<li>Vok (Vox?), a dwarven cleric of Gozreh. Scholar.<br> A
				simple, standard dwarf cleric healbot. So far, anyway. Gozreh is
				introduced in the campaign supplements, so probably figures somewhat
				down the road a bit.
			</li>
			<li>Unconscious dude.</br> We hope to be joined next session by
				another player, which will round out the party to four. The party is
				missing a rogue, anything arcane, and a character with an
				intelligence score worth mentioning. I'm thinking of building a
				warlock (easy to play). <br> Then again, an Archaeologist Bard
				ticks all the boxes and make a lot of sense. It's a powergamer
				skill-monkey class: I played one for years in organised play. You
				get all the things, and lose only DPS. But that's what the cavalier
				and ranger are for.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>With an archaeologist, this party could work.</p>

		<h3>Game 0</h3>
		<div class="ooc">Most of game 0 is character creation, of
			course. But I pushed to get at least something happening before we
			all went home, to whet the appetite, and maybe to motivate my players
			to read some of the campaign material. The initial beach encounter is
			a great setup.</div>

		<p>Snid is dreaming</p>
		<div class="dream">You’re back aboard the Jenivere, bent over
			the railing being seasick. After your latest bout of retching, you
			slump back and see the rest of the passengers and crew are on deck as
			well, all of them sick save for the captain and the quiet Varisian
			scholar Ieana. She whispers in the captain’s ear, then gives him a
			kiss on the cheek. At that point the captain holds up a wooden soup
			spoon, and you realize that you’re holding one as well. Everyone has
			a spoon. The ship is sinking, and the only way to stop it is to bail
			out the hold with your spoon! You work feverishly, but the waters
			keep rushing in. Just before you wake, you can see monstrous things
			with pincers in the water trying to claw their way into the ship...</div>
		<div class="imgright">
			<img src="seascorp.png" width="100%">
		</div>
		<p>Last thing anyone remembers is dinner at the captain's table
			aboard the Jenivere. Now, somehow, they are on a tropical beach,
			unconscious. The party wakes up one at a time, still sick, still
			queasy. But no time for that, because crab-like crustaceans about the
			size of a dog have emerged from the sea and are nibbling on the
			party.</p>
		<p>The party are dressed as they were at the captain's table - no
			armour, no weapons except for their daggers. But they reasonably
			easily kill the sea scorpions with those. Then they take stock.</p>
		<p>Their gear is stacked up in a neat pile further up the beach,
			although it's a mystery how it got there. Footprints leading from the
			surf to the beach indicate - perhaps one of the crew? But where are
			they now? Their queasiness fades with a final vomit. Vox is certain
			they have all been poisoned, but it seems not fatally so.</p>
		<p>There are nine people on the beach - the three that have just
			woken, another five, and one who is still heavily unconcious. All are
			passengers - no crew, no captain. One passenger is missing, the
			Varisian scholar Ieana.</p>
		<p>The other passengers are wary, guarded. All except Sasha Nevah,
			who is a cheerful sort. The prisoner - Jask Derindi - still wears his
			manacles. Looking about, they see they are on a narrow beach at the
			end of a small cove. Behind and around them rise nasty, volcanic
			basalt cliffs - jagged and sharp, but climbable. Atop the cliffs,
			thick tropical jungle. About half a mile away they see the Jenevere,
			fetched up on rocks in the churning surf. She will never sail again,
			and before long the sea will claim her. But aboard her still is rope,
			canvas, carpenter's tools and wood, and something else.</p>
		<p>"Horse!", cries Kraig. "We have to go get horse, he's still in
			his pen, I'm sure. I'll go alone if no-one will help."</p>
		<p>"Low tide should be mid-morning", replies Vox, "it's the only
			way - we can't swim in that surf. By late afternoon, that ship will
			be swept off the rocks."</p>
		<p>It's dawn, and it's already starting to get hot and humid. Far
			above in the jungle, the birds are kicking up a cacophony which will
			continue non-stop all day long, save during the usual downpour mid
			afternoon. The castaways need to set up camp. They need fire to repel
			the mosquitoes during the night, they need something to boil water
			in. They need to rescue horse. And of the five other companions on
			the beach, only one seems ready to help.</p>
		<p>Its day 1 on Smuggler's Shiv.</p>
