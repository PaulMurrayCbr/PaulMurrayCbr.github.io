		<h2>Part 1: Souls for Smuggler's Shiv</h2>
		<h3>Game 7</h3>

		<div class="ooc">
			<p>Dinner was slow-cooked thai yellow curry chicken & veg, with
				not enough salt and some cardamom pods that were laying around the
				kitchen and frankly were a bit of a mistake, and rice. I am dining
				on leftovers as I type.</p>
			<p>In-game, we were missing our cleric again, who was having a
				very trying time with kids and teeth and just not enough spoons to
				navigate a cold and wet night on Canberra roads. Consequently, we
				did some more exploring rather than advance the plot of the
				adventure.</p>

		<div class="gameday">Day 35</div>
		<p>
			Day 35, the survivors of the <cite>Jenivere</cite> spend a day moving
			camp to Pezcock's beach.
		</p>
		<div class="ooc">We did this at the end of last session &hellip;
			I think I may have messed up the calendar a little, but meh: being
			trapped on a deserted island does tend to make you lose track of
			time.</div>

			Day 36, they spend a day mapping out the northwestern cape of the
			island. They find the causeway that Pezcock mentioned, providing
			access to the first of two small islands, and sight a wreck. However,
			low tide is at 9, and so the wreck will have to wait until tomorrow.
			Hopefully, it will be Gelick's <cite>Nightvoice</cite>.

		<p>But the day does not go according to plan.</p>
		<p>In the morning they are attacked by two wild boars whose
			territory they have entered. One of them is big, but the other is
			monstrous. Snid manages to distract the smaller of the two by
			retreating to a tree when it charges him. The smaller boar slams the
			tree, attempting to dislodge him, but Snid's tail proves its worth.
			Not that it matters, because then Snid jumps out of the tree onto the
			boar, and attempts to calm it. This does not go well, but it keeps
			the thing busy. Unable to bring its tusks to bear, it settles for
			slamming Snid around as they grapple.</p>
		<div class="ooc">I didn't apply the grapple rules correctly,
			which will surprise no-one familiar with 3.5/Pathfinder I grapple
			rules.</div>
		<p>The massive boar charged Jack, who was badly hurt. Kraig
			stepped in and challenged the beast. He and Nyx together managed to
			subdue it, although Kraig was nearly downed by the thing, needing
			heals from Jack. In the end, Nyx's precisely-placed kama slashes
			managed to bleed it, with a final spectacular slash finishing it off.
		</p>
		<div class="ooc">Kraig the Cavalier and Nyx the Ninja form a
			classic Tank/Glass Cannon combo. Kraig keeps the monsters focused on
			himself with his cavalier's challenge, and Nyx does massive damage
			with sneak attack and Bleeding Critical feat.</div>
		<p>
			With the smaller boar left to take care of, there was quite a bit of
			confusion and table talk, but no - generally speaking it is very
			difficult to calm down a vicious (not to mention <a
				href="https://pathfinder.d20srd.org/bestiary/universalMonsterRules.html#ferocity">Ferocious</a>)
			wild animal that is in the act of ripping you a new one. In the end,
			they had to do things the usual way.
		</p>
		<p>
			After this, everyone except Nyx was hurt, and they opted to not risk
			anything further. They spent a day recovering, Kraig's Order of The
			Sheild medical training coming into play. Next day they briefly
			investigated the wreck, which proved to be Pezcock's old ship: the <cite>Crow's
				Tooth</cite>. Then they headed straight back to camp and their cleric for
			another day of rest on day 39.
		</p>
		<div class="ooc">I rolled middling on the wandering monster
			table, and picked something that I was pretty sure the party could
			manage. Just the one dire boar, not 1d4 of them. A single one is CR
			4. Added the other boar because I don't approve of encounters with
			just a single monster all by itself unless there's plot reasons for
			it. In the end, I didn't have to nerf it, so I'm pleased that my
			DM-fu was strong enough to gauge the encounter correctly. Although I
			did wince when I found out how much XP I was going to be awarding.</div>

		<div class="gameday">Day 40-44</div>
		<p>Over the next few days, our party explore most of the northwest
			part of the island, finding another one of the cannibal's jungle
			paths, which they avoid.</p>
		<p>They cross the causeway to the first of two small islands off
			around the western edge of the islan'd central bay. The second island
			is also reachable by a causeway, but one much lower than the first -
			it will likely only be usable at low tide, and crossing it means
			being trapped on the other island for a day.</p>
		<p>Which is a problem:</p>
		<p class="dream">This bleak island stands out to anyone who casts
			her gaze to the west, for whereas the rest of Smuggler’s Shiv is a
			luscious green and a riot of jungle sounds, this island is a silent
			gray scar on the horizon. From afar, the island may look as if it is
			covered with trees, but up close the “trees” are revealed to be foul
			gray stalks of fibrous fungus, growing up into the air almost like
			stalagmites in a cave. Between these weird stalks, the “undergrowth”
			consists of thick wiry tangles of lichens and gray fungus, all
			growing on a foul-smelling muddy surface. With the exception of the
			waves crashing along the beaches, the island is eerily silent.</p>
		<p>They all decide to wuss out.</p>
		<p>The next few days see more exploration. The party sight the
			kinda magical area of the island that Pezcock mentioned - a rise
			rather than a hill. But it is a few miles away and there's no telling
			what might be there, if anything. They also stumble on a shocker
			lizard lair.</p>
		<div class="ooc">Hearty and deeply gratifying groans of "Oh God,
			not these things again!" all around the table. But what can I do? I
			mean - this lair is actually in the module, it's not a random
			encounter. My hands were tied, dudes.</div>
		<p>
			They end up back at camp at Pezcock's giant crab. Tomorrow, it will
			be day 45 marooned on <cite>Smuggler's Shiv</cite>.
