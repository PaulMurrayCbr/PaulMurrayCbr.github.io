		<div class="ooc">
			<p>Dinner was lamb roast, salt and pepper rub, and way, way too
				much garlic. Can there be such a thing? Yes. Yes there can. Made
				gravy out of the goop at the bottom of the tray, but made the
				mistake of adding salt. Not necessary, b/c was already plenty of
				salt in it. You gotta taste the food before you salt it.</p>
			<p>We were a party member down. Jack, this time. Not sure what
				the player was up to - probably getting laid or some nonsense like
				that.</p>
			<p>I have, once more, left it to the last minute to update this
				page.</p>

		<div class="gameday">Day 56-49</div>
		<div class='boxtext'>A jungle trail comes to an abrupt end at a
			fifty-foot-high cliff overlooking the sea below. A number of knotted
			ropes and vines hang over the edge, leading down to a rocky beach
			below.</div>
		<p>The party faff about, working on completing the map. They
			discover more trails made by the cannibals, encountering a group of
			six of them at one point. The cannibal trail leads to a calm beach
			where there are piles of shucked oyster shells. Perhaps the cannibals
			like oysters? Perhaps pearls? Either way, it all looks too much like
			work, and the party decline.</p>
		<div class="boxtext">An overgrown jungle path leads to a small
			clearing where a partially collapsed hut stands on the banks of a
			gurgling stream. The hut itself seems to have been made from a
			combination of driftwood and tree trunks, with a roof of wide leaves
			and strips of rotten canvas sail. The front door to the hut hangs
			partially ajar. Dozens of bones and skulls—quite obviously of human
			origin—decorate the hut and the surrounding area, each bearing
			numerous nicks and scratches.</div>
		<p>They find an abandoned hut, but it is long, long uninhabited. A
			bit odd, actually - the skulls and bones littering the area do not
			seem quite so old as the hut itself.</p>
		<img width="100%" src="006-055 PZO9037 Shiv-NOTES.png">
		<p>They do, however, find something that looks like a journal.</p>
		<p>
			They move camp to a more strategic location - hidden, but with access
			to the cannibal's jungle paths. They will have to deal with those
			cannibals soon. Tomorrow, it will be day 50 marooned on <cite>Smuggler's
				Shiv</cite>.
