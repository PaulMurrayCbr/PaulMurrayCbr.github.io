			<p>No game this week. We were a player down, and two people had
				to leave early for reasons.</p>
			<p>Everyone has hit level 4, so I spent the evening on herolab
				with each player in turn. Ninja had their character sorted, for
				everyone else we were paging though lists of feats from obscure
				sourcebooks that even I don't know what they do and which I am not
				using in this campaign. I also put in their current armour, weapons,
				and permanent gear - rings of protection, that sort of thing. I am
				handing out consumables as post-it notes and slips of paper.</p>
			<p>Ranger now has a pet viper, God help me.</p>
			<p>Kisune Ninja now has a Dex of 20, without jewelry.</p>
			<p>
				Bard took Polyglot, but rather than picking languages now he will be
				able to learn the languages as he encounters them. Let's say its
				something magical to do with his <i class="spell">Comprehend
					Languages</i> spell. Somehow, the character manages to make it "stick".
			</p>
			<p>Cleric didn't get much. More spells, and "1d6 for every 2
				levels of cleric" effects are now 2d6.</p>
			<p>Cavalier was at a work Christmas party.</p>
			<p>And we have a new player. The player who played Pezcock for me
				has settled on an Oread druid. I should refuse - stone glide is
				broken and OP. But, here we are. Other players were saying they need
				more melee, with which I disagree. But the player rolled well, and
				this druid will be able to hand out and soak up a fair bit of
				damage.</p>
			<p>In general, people were a little lost as to what they should
				pick. Pathfinder 1 is complex. But toughness, dodge, and improved
				initiative are however always solid choices and never go astray.</p>
			<p>
				Six at the table and two animal companions is a big party, and
				combat will tend to bog down. OTOH, it means we can easily manage
				people being out occasionally. A druid casts <i class="spell">Summon
					Nature's Ally</i>, so my rule is: if you summon it, you need to know
				its stats, FFS.
			</p>
			<div>
				<h3>TODO</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>export the party to XML to update the character roster
						that you can access from the menu.</li>
					<li>put the quest reward buffs from the NPCs into herolab.</li>
					<li>remove from herolab splatbooks that are not being used in
						this campaign.</li>
					<li>work on the XSLT for the character roster - it's
						unfinished.</li>
					<li>squash the branch. A couple of the commits have large
						images that I have subsequently shrunk, but because they are in
						the commit history they still take up space.</li>
				</ul>

			<p style="margin-top: 1em;">Dinner was gluten-free gnocci, with a
				ham and cheese cream sauce. My fridge is now full of sugary drink.
				And a "no caffeine, no sugar" version of Coke which IMO makes zero
				sense. It's like drinking no-alcohol beer. Why?</p>
