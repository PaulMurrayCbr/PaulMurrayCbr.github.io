		<h2>Part 1: Souls for Smuggler's Shiv</h2>
		<h3>Game 5</h3>

		<div class="ooc">
			<p>For game 5, dinner was a traditional postwar horror like my
				mum used to make (mum was born in '25). Sausage &amp; mash, tinned
				peas, cauli and carrot. The tinned peas were an unappetizing grayish
				teal colour, just like I remember. Also made an onion/red wine/beef
				stock gravy thing which had way too much butter and was greasy, but
				that was my own creation.</p>
			<p>I discovered that that kind of meal is actually way more
				hassle than what I usually do these days - all those pots on the go,
				and the frypan to sautee the onions. Thank you Jesus, for inventing
				the slow-cooker and the dishwasher.</p>
			<p>But on the plus side, a kilo and a half of mashed potatos and
				there was actually something left, and everyone around the table
				commenting that they felt bloated. John fell into a carb coma. Nice.</p>
			<p>I would love to treat everyone to another of her favourites:
				spaghetti boiled mercilessly for three quarts of an hour until it
				swells up into a kind of gel, but sadly, one of my players is gluten
				intolerant.</p>
			<p>Can't have everything, I guess.</p>

			Early morning, a ghost rises from the campfire, the same as they saw
			before calling for "Ashmara"! But Kraig immediately works out what to
			do, and presents to the ghost of Captain Kinkarian the image in the
			locket that they found aboard the <cite>Brine Demon</cite>. The
			captain fades away, and the image in the locket with him. Together at
			last, perhaps. In any case, they have done a good deed today, and
			laid to rest one of the ghosts of <cite>Smuggler's Shiv</cite>. But
			there are many more.

			Day 28 they explore, investigating the wreck of the <cite>Windwar</cite>.
			But, no loot.
		</p>
		<p>But at night, the jungle creatures come. This time: a panther!
			It attacks (I think) NIx up in the tree where she was standing watch.
			A tough fight, and Nix is knocked out and needs healing from Volka.
			But with that, she Ki jumps back up into the tree from prone (!). I
			think Jack P may have stolen the kill.</p>
		<div class="ooc">The panther was a lion. The wandering monster
			table isn't split into level-appropriate tables, so judgment must be
			applied. More than one lions would definitely have taxed the party.
			Combat was slowed by my having to look up rules for pounce and rend.
			And grapple. BUt, all good and I got one PC down, so a fine evening's
			work.</div>

			The next three days are busy. The party begin to use the paths made
			by the islands presumptive cannibals, encountering the ruins of the
			encampment made by the survivors of the <cite>Bearded Harpy</cite>.
			In one of the driftwood shelters is carved a crude pentagram and
			hammred into it are teeth from more than one human. Pentagram! Jack P
			recalls that the rumour has it that there are survivors of a Chellish
			colony here, Chelliax being a place where devils rule and
			devil-worship is pretty much the state religion.
		</p>
		<p>Exploring the trails, they encounter one, two, three, four
			cleverly-set snares. They spot three, but Snid trips the fourth.
			However, he avoids being caught with his monkey tail. Just as well:
			the snares are set to hurl the victim against spiked plates set into
			the tree.</p>
		<div class="ooc">Kiz took a "tail" feat for his Vanara ranger,
			which I have not put into herolab yet. The feat grants +2 to CMD vs.
			trip. The trap is vs CMD, and the +2 put him over the save DC. I
			didn't get one of them, man.</div>
		<p>They move camp again, to about a mile from the nearest trail,
			having to deal with a giant crab at the beach in the process of so
			doing. And they are finally close enough to get a decent look at that
			"orange" thing that they saw from the other side of the bay. It's a
			giant crab about the size of a house.</p>
		<p>
			So. Enormous giant crab. Paths to explore. The oddly grey island.
			Cannibals. Gelik is still looking for the <cite>Nightvoice</cite>.
			And they are all looking for that lighthouse. When dawn next breaks,
			it will be day 32 on <cite>Smuggler's Shiv</cite>.
