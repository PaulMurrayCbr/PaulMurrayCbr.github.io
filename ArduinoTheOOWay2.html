			<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-top: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">Yeah.
			But his actual post is that – to start with – he'd like to
			have a length of track with end stops, batting the trains back and
			forth. Thing is, he'd like more than one of them.</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-top: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">So
			lets dive straight into it.s</P>
			<H2 CLASS="western">Overall design</H2>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-top: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">So,
			I'll have track objects. A track object knows which way the train
			is currently going on it. It owns a couple of end-stop objects.
			The track asks these things, “say, is the train on you?” and
			if it is, it changes the direction of the train, which involves a
			sequence of things involving time. There's other ways to do this,
			of course – event driven models with events. But this will do
			for now. Likewise, it might be worthwhile making another layer of
			abstract class to separate out the underlying logic from the
			sequence of stuff a track has to do to change the direction fo the
			train … you know what? I'll slice this a bit differently. It's
			going to be fine.</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-top: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">The OP
			is using LDRs for the end stops, but there's a bunch of things he
			could be using. Likewise, there are plenty of ways to shunt a
			train around. So I'll be using <U>abstract classes</U>. As with
			part 1, I'll give all of my things a time slice. Now, this is not
			really necessary for the LDRs, but what if at some stage in the
			future we want to use a different type of sensor altogether? What
			if the sensor is some sort of remote thing that needs to be
			polled, and has latency? Nope – I'll do things the way I always
			do them: everything gets a setup() and a loop().</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-top: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">So,
			the first thing to do is to define my 'this thing gets a
			time-slice' class, and the frameowrk that runs everything.</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-top: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>

			<PRE>class Runnable {
  public:
    virtual void setup() {
    }

    virtual void loop() {
    }
};


Runnable *all_runnable_objects[] = {};

void setup() {
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; sizeof(all_runnable_objects) / sizeof(*all_runnable_objects); i++) {
    all_runnable_objects[i]-&gt;setup();
  }
}

void loop() {
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; sizeof(all_runnable_objects) / sizeof(*all_runnable_objects); i++) {
    all_runnable_objects[i]-&gt;loop();
  }
}</PRE><P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-top: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
			Now, that's a fair bit of very weird code. But all it does is: for
			each thing in our array that's a runnable, call setup() and
			loop(). As we define and create runnable objects, we will add them
			to the array. The setup() and loop() methods are defined to be
			<U>virtual</U>. This means that <U>subclasses</U> are allowed to
			<U>override</U> those methods with their own implementation. The
			default implementations do nothing.</P>
			<H2 CLASS="western">The end stops</H2>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-top: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">Ok!
			the end stop class is quite simple:</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-top: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
			</P>
			<PRE>class EndStop {
  public:
    virtual boolean trainSensed();
};</PRE><P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-top: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
			All this does is say “anything that is an end stop can say yes
			or no that there's a train on it”. But our OP has a specific
			kind of end stop – one that uses an L:DR hooked to an analog
			pin:</P>
			<PRE>class LDREndStop : public EndStop {
    const byte ldrPin = A0;

  public:

    boolean trainSensed() {
      return analogRead(ldrPin) &gt;= 400;
    }
};

LDREndStop endStopA, endStopB, endStopC, endStopD;</PRE><P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-top: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
			Now, you can hopefully see the problem here – all the end stops
			are going to be using the same pin. We need for each end stop to
			“know” what pin it uses, and so I'll use a <U><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">constructor</SPAN></U>.</P>
			<PRE>class LDREndStop : public EndStop {
    const byte ldrPin;

  public:

    LDREndStop(byte pin) : ldrPin(pin) {
    }

    boolean trainSensed() {
      return analogRead(ldrPin) &gt;= 400;
    }
};

LDREndStop endStopA(A0), endStopB(A1), endStopC(A2), endStopD(A3);</PRE><P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-top: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
			Great! Now all of our LDR end stops know what pin they are
			supposed to look at, and can report back that a train has been
			sensed to anything that wants to know. We don't need anything else
			for these – they don't need time slices, so there's nothing more
			to do.</P>
			<H2 CLASS="western">The track</H2>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-top: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">And
			now things become complicated. A track knows which way its train
			is currently going, and has two end stops. But the detais of how
			to change the directopn of a train – I want to put that in a
			subclass whose job it is to sequence relays. So, at any iven time
			a track will be moving towards A, changing to B, moving towards B,
			or changing to A. it will cooperate with its subclasses by way of
			methods that are left undefined for the subclass to implement.</P>

    EndStop&amp; endA;

			When the track senses that it needs to change direction, it tells
